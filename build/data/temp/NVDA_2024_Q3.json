  "reasoning": "First and foremost, this falls well outside my circle of competence. Semiconductors are a fast-moving, cyclical business with rapid technology shifts \u2013 I know enough to know I don\u2019t know enough. That alone would steer me to the sidelines. On the moat front, NVIDIA posts impressive ROEs north of 25% and steamy operating margins near 76%, but in my experience few advantages in chips stand the test of decades \u2013 Moore\u2019s Law cuts both ways, and barriers to entry erode as quickly as they build. Pricing power exists in narrow windows but the long game is precarious.\n\nManagement has delivered strong growth, but the recent common stock issuance and absence of dividends give me pause. My mantra is \u201cmanagement that acts like owners,\u201d and constant dilution doesn\u2019t inspire confidence in capital allocation. Financially, the business is sound \u2013 low debt, solid owner earnings near $18 B, and relentless earnings growth \u2013 but consistency alone doesn\u2019t make a wonderfully simple business.\n\nValuation is the knockout blow here. A three-stage DCF pegs conservative intrinsic value at roughly $280 B, yet the market cap towers over $2.7 T, leaving a negative margin of safety of nearly 90%. As I\u2019ve said, \u201cprice is what you pay, value is what you get,\u201d and paying ten times intrinsic value is like buying a diamond ring for the price of a mansion hoping it\u2019ll keep up with the neighbors.\n\nLong term, I respect NVIDIA\u2019s role in AI and data centers, but I worry about technological obsolescence, fierce competition, and reliance on capital-intensive fabs \u2013 a recipe for permanent capital loss when cycles turn. By contrast, I\u2019d rather own a business like Coca-Cola or See\u2019s Candies with durable brands and simple economics at a fair price than wrestle with complexity at a crazy price. \n\nIn short, I\u2019ll stick to what I understand, demand a margin of safety, and pass on NVIDIA here.",
