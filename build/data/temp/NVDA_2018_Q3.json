  "reasoning": "First things first, semiconductors are outside my circle of competence. I don\u2019t pretend to understand the complex physics and rapid technological shifts Nvidia faces. That\u2019s a tough business to forecast over decades. \n\nMoat: While Nvidia has terrific operating margins (averaging 62.6%) and high performance stability (85.7%), I\u2019m uneasy calling that a durable moat. Technology moats can erode overnight when chips get faster or regulations change. This isn\u2019t the wide-moat consumer franchise of Coca-Cola or Apple\u2019s ecosystem. \n\nManagement: I see a recent stock issuance and no dividend policy. I have no reason to doubt their honesty, but I\u2019d prefer managers who think like owners and return capital to shareholders, as we\u2019ve done at See\u2019s Candies and GEICO. \n\nFinancial health & consistency: They boast strong operating margins and modest debt, but their ROE is inconsistent (only 1 of 10 periods above 15%) and earnings growth is all over the map. I like steady, predictable results. \n\nValuation: At a market value near $118 billion, the stock price sits roughly 88% above our conservative intrinsic value of $14 130 per share. Paying up like that removes any margin of safety. \n\nLong-term prospects & red flags: GPUs are hot today, but competition and rapid innovation pose risks. I\u2019d rather own BNSF or a utility where the future is easier to forecast. \n\nComparison: We\u2019d own a wonderful business at a fair price, not this fair business at a wonderful price. In my book, Nvidia checks neither box. So I\u2019ll pass.",
