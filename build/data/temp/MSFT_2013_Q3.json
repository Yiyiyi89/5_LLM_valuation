  "reasoning": "First off, Microsoft isn\u2019t a corn business, a rail, a bank or an insurance operation \u2013 it\u2019s complex enterprise software and cloud computing. In other words, it falls outside my circle of competence. As I\u2019ve often said, \u201cRisk comes from not knowing what you\u2019re doing,\u201d and I don\u2019t claim to fully grasp the subtleties of software platforms and cloud infrastructure the way I do a soft drink or a simple insurance company.  \n\nSecond, while there are signs of a competitive moat \u2013 strong operating margins north of 80% and decent performance stability \u2013 the company\u2019s spotty ROE history (0 out of 10 periods above 15%) and inconsistent earnings growth (\u20138.7% over the last ten periods) suggest the advantage isn\u2019t as durable as a brand like Coca-Cola or the ecosystem around Apple.  \n\nThird, management has diluted shareholders recently with new stock issuance and offers only minimal dividends. I look for managers who think like owners, allocate capital prudently and pay steady dividends when possible. That\u2019s not what I see here.  \n\nFourth, the balance sheet shows a debt\u2010to\u2010equity ratio near 0.75 and weak return on invested capital around 4.5%. Those metrics give me pause compared with the financial fortress I demand.  \n\nFifth, the valuation is out of whack. A three\u2010stage DCF pegs intrinsic value near $60,600 but the market cap suggests a steep premium. The margin of safety is negative 74%, which flies in the face of my rule to pay significantly less than true value.  \n\nSixth, looking twenty years down the road, Microsoft faces fierce competition from AWS, Google, open source players and shifting technology trends. That\u2019s a lot of ifs and buts for a business I don\u2019t fully understand.  \n\nFinally, when I compare this to ideas in my portfolio \u2013 Coca-Cola\u2019s rock\u2010solid brand, See\u2019s Candies\u2019 sweet economics or Apple\u2019s consumer ecosystem \u2013 Microsoft just doesn\u2019t sparkle with the same simplicity, durability or margin of safety. So, on balance, I\u2019d say no. There\u2019s no penalty for being patient, and my capital is better deployed where I have both expertise and a sensible price.",
