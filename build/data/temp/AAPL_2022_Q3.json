  "reasoning": "First off, Apple is dead center in my circle of competence. I know consumer products, ecosystems and brands, and Apple\u2019s iPhone\u2010to\u2010App\u2010Store franchise and sticky user base are about as textbook a moat as you\u2019ll find. When I bought Coca-Cola shares in 1988, I marveled at their brand and pricing power. Apple is a tech variation of that story.\n\nOn the moat front, the numbers tell the tale: nine out of ten years of ROE north of 15 percent (average 31.2 percent), operating margins hovering in the mid-40s and performance stability above 80 percent. That\u2019s durable pricing power\u2014you raise your prices and customers keep buying, just like See\u2019s Candies or Gillette.\n\nManagement quality is a bit of mixed bag here. Tim Cook & Co. have shown masterful capital allocation through share buybacks and dividends, but seasoning that with recent share issuances is a wrinkle. Apple tends to think like owners, but I\u2019ll keep an eye on any dilution or overly aggressive financial engineering.\n\nOn the financial health side, ROE of 33.5 percent and operating margin of 46.6 percent are spectacular. The debt\u2010to\u2010equity of 4.8 looks high on paper, but given $170+ billion of net cash and fortress balance sheet, it\u2019s manageable. My only quibble is the patchy consistency analysis, though real earnings have grown 72.8 percent over ten years.\n\nThe real stumbling block here is price. A three-stage DCF pegs conservative intrinsic value at roughly $138,500 per share versus today\u2019s market price. That works out to a negative 93.5 percent margin of safety. \"Price is what you pay; value is what you get,\" and right now you\u2019re paying a stinkin\u2019 premium for a great business.\n\nLong term, I\u2019m a fan\u2014Apple will likely hum along for decades. But compared to opportunities like Coca-Cola at a fair valuation or bank stocks trading below book, I\u2019ll sit this one out. A wonderful business at an awful price is still an awful investment. The only answer here is \"no.\"",
