  "reasoning": "First off, Netflix falls outside my circle of competence. I stick to businesses I can wrap my head around like Coca-Cola, consumer staples, insurance or railroads \u2013 not a capital-intensive, rapidly evolving streaming service. Second, its moat looks questionable. While consistent operating margins suggest some pricing power, the inconsistency in ROE and the flood of competitors from Disney to Amazon erodes any lasting advantage. Third, management has grown the business aggressively, but there\u2019s no dividend or buybacks, and content spending piles on debt \u2013 capital allocation feels more \u2018spend to keep up\u2019 than owner-friendly. Fourth, the balance sheet carries a debt-to-equity north of 2:1 and earnings growth has been lumpy, a far cry from the steady return streams I prefer. Fifth, the stock trades above our conservative intrinsic value estimate of about $25,600, leaving no margin of safety \u2013 you don\u2019t want to pay more than a business is worth. Sixth, long-term prospects hinge on ever-higher content costs and technology shifts \u2013 real red flags for durability. Finally, compared to the strong franchises in my portfolio that I\u2019d happily hold forever at reasonable prices, Netflix simply doesn\u2019t measure up. If forced to choose, I\u2019d pass and keep cash for a business with a moat I truly understand.",
