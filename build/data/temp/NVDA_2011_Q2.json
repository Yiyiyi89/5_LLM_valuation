  "confidence": 0.95,
  "reasoning": "First off, Nvidia falls well outside my circle of competence. GPUs, AI acceleration and the intricacies of semiconductor cycles are things I\u2019d rather watch from the stands than bet the farm on. As I\u2019ve said, 'Risk comes from not knowing what you\u2019re doing.' Next, while Nvidia enjoys strong operating margins averaging over 44%, its inconsistent ROE \u2013 only one out of ten periods above 15% \u2013 tells me the economics can swing wildly. A true economic moat must earn consistent returns year in and year out. Management has been prudent with capital, issuing little stock and retaining earnings, but they pay virtually no dividends, and I have no way of knowing how well they\u2019ll allocate today\u2019s windfall in a tougher environment tomorrow. The balance sheet looks solid with low debt, yet earnings growth has been lumpy. As for valuation, the DCF implies a conservative intrinsic value around $1,746 a share, but the stock is trading roughly 80% above that level \u2013 far from my margin-of-safety zone. In contrast, I\u2019d much rather own a sure-thing business like Coca-Cola or Apple within my circle, at a fair price, than pay a steep premium for forecasts I can't confidently make. So my signal here is decidedly bearish.",
