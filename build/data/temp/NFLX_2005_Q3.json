  "reasoning": "1. Circle of Competence: I don\u2019t invest in complex, capital-intensive technology businesses. Streaming video with endless content wars and shifting consumer tastes is outside my wheelhouse. As I say, \u201cRisk comes from not knowing what you\u2019re doing,\u201d and I\u2019m not in the content creation business.\n2. Competitive Moat: Netflix may have strong brand recognition, but its moat is thin and ephemeral. Operating margins are high, but memorably I\u2019ve said that margins can be stolen away by competitors. With Disney+, Amazon, HBO Max and others nipping at its heels, I see little durable pricing power or switching costs that will last decades.\n3. Management Quality: Management has borrowed heavily to fund content, running owner-earnings deeply negative at \u2013$53 per share. That strikes me as aggressive capital allocation: piling on debt for an uncertain payoff. I prefer managers who \u201cthink like owners,\u201d not those who chase growth at any cost.\n4. Financial Health and Consistency: Netflix shows weak ROE (3.9%) and ROIC (2.5%), high debt-to-equity (0.56), and inconsistent earnings growth. Owner earnings are negative, and the balance sheet is far from fortress-like. I look for consistent, predictable cash flows, and Netflix simply doesn\u2019t deliver.\n5. Valuation vs. Intrinsic Value: A three-stage DCF yields a negative intrinsic value (\u2013$421 per share) and a margin of safety of \u2013137%. That tells me the market is not pricing in the business\u2019s own negative owner earnings. I never buy a fair business at a wonderful price\u2014and here there\u2019s neither a wonderful business nor a wonderful price.\n6. Long-Term Prospects & Red Flags: The streaming landscape is a marathon of licensing battles, rising content costs and fierce competition. I\u2019d rather own a simple consumer product with stable demand. Netflix\u2019s model requires perpetual content investment and debt\u2014too many red flags for a buy-and-hold.\n7. Opportunity Cost: Given competing ideas\u2014Coca-Cola\u2019s predictable cash flows, See\u2019s Candies\u2019 sticky brand, Apple\u2019s ecosystem and BNSF\u2019s railroad moat\u2014I\u2019d put my money where I can see a durable advantage and margin of safety. Netflix fails on both counts.\nIn short, Netflix falls outside my circle, sports a fleeting moat, burdens itself with debt, generates inconsistent returns and carries no margin of safety. My verdict: bearish.",
