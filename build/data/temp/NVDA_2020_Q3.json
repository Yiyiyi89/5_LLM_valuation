  "reasoning": "First off, semiconductors like NVIDIA lie well outside my circle of competence. I\u2019ve stuck to businesses I understand\u2014Coca-Cola\u2019s fizzy chemistry, See\u2019s Candies\u2019 sweet margins, Apple\u2019s consumer ecosystem\u2014not the ebb and flow of GPU fabs and wafer yields. When you don\u2019t understand exactly how the game is played, risk comes from not knowing what you\u2019re doing.\n\nAs for its moat, NVIDIA shows strong operating margins (around 69%) and price power in AI chips, but inconsistent ROE\u2014zero out of ten years above 15%\u2014suggests that moat isn\u2019t as durable as it looks on the surface. Good margin today doesn\u2019t guarantee it tomorrow in a rapidly evolving tech space.\n\nOn management, recent stock issuance raises my eyebrow. I like to see capital allocation that works in shareholders\u2019 favor\u2014think Berkshire\u2019s disciplined repurchases or dividends at Coca-Cola\u2014not dilution. Minimal dividends here also mean limited cash return to owners.\n\nFinancially, the 0.75 debt-to-equity ratio and patchy earnings growth undermine the consistency I prize. I prefer businesses earning reliably across cycles. While book value has grown, owner earnings are lumpy, and the long-term consistency test isn\u2019t passed.\n\nValuation is the last nail in this coffin. Even with a generous three-stage DCF, a 15% haircut puts intrinsic value around $15,770, yet the market price implies a negative 94% margin of safety. I\u2019d rather own a wonderful business at a fair price than a fair business at a wonderful price.\n\nLong term, the AI story is exciting, but rapid technological change and fierce competition introduce risks I can\u2019t quantify. I\u2019d rather sit on my hands than overpay for complexity when I can redeploy capital into simpler franchises like consumer staples, insurance, or our old friend Apple\u2014where I know the economics, management, and margins.\n\nIn my portfolio, opportunities that meet all my tests are scarce. NVIDIA may be great for a tech specialist, but it fails my first and most important test: Circle of Competence. My vote here is a firm \u201cno.\u201d",
