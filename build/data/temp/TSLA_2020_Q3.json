  "reasoning": "1. Circle of Competence: Tesla is a high\u2010tech, capital\u2010intensive EV and software play\u2014far outside my wheelhouse. I stick to simple businesses I can understand, like Coca-Cola or GEICO. 2. Moat: While Tesla\u2019s 27.8% operating margins hint at pricing power, its inconsistent ROE (just 0 of 10 years above 15%) undermines a durable competitive advantage. 3. Management: Elon Musk is visionary but unpredictable, prone to big share issuances, no dividends, and erratic capital allocation. I need owners who act methodically. 4. Financial Health: ROE of 1.9%, D/E of 1.6, patchy earnings growth, negative owner earnings\u2014all red flags for a financial fortress. 5. Valuation: My three-stage DCF spits out a negative intrinsic value (-$8,542 conservative), giving a margin of safety of -103%. Paying $306B today makes no sense. 6. Long-Term Prospects: The auto sector is cutthroat, cyclical, and driven by subsidies and regulation. 7. Opportunity Cost: I\u2019d rather deploy capital in Coca-Cola, Apple or a solid bank with pricing power, consistent free cash flow, and a proven moat. When in doubt, I say no\u2014so this is a clear no for me.",
