  "reasoning": "First thing I ask myself is: does this fall within my circle of competence? It doesn\u2019t. Microsoft is a wonderful franchise with strong brand, network effects and high operating margins, but it\u2019s a complex technology business outside the realm of consumer staples or simple infrastructure that Charlie and I truly understand (Apple is the lone exception in tech for us). \n\nOn economic moats, you can\u2019t deny Microsoft\u2019s dominant Windows and Office franchises, Azure scale advantage and switching costs for enterprise customers. Yet the moat looks more like a trench with gaps\u2014ROE has been only 5.5% on average, inconsistent earnings growth is down nearly 22% over the last ten periods, and operating-margin excellence hasn\u2019t translated into durable return on capital above 15%. That tells me the competitive advantage may not be as unbreachable as headlines suggest. \n\nOn management, Satya Nadella has steered the ship admirably, but the recent common-stock issuance and lack of juicy dividends fly in the face of the owner-operator behavior we prize in our portfolio holdings like Coca-Cola or See\u2019s Candies. I want capital allocation that screams \u201cI\u2019m acting like an owner,\u201d not quietly diluting shareholders. \n\nFinancially, while margins are strong, the balance sheet shows a debt-to-equity of about 1.0\u2014higher than we\u2019d like for a business that hasn\u2019t produced consistent double-digit returns on equity. And earnings consistency matters: we want predictable, fortress-grade earnings, and Microsoft\u2019s have been too zig-zag. \n\nValuation? The three-stage DCF pegs intrinsic value at roughly $26,100 while the market capitalization sits north of $328 billion, implying a negative margin of safety near 92%. I\u2019d rather own a wonderful business at a fair price than an ordinary one at a lofty price. \n\nLong term, technology evolves rapidly. Today\u2019s leader can become tomorrow\u2019s also-ran. If I had the chance, I\u2019d deploy capital into businesses I understand inside and out\u2014Coca-Cola, American Express, BNSF Railway\u2014where the moat is clear, management behaves like owners, and I actually have a prayer of valuing the future cash flows. Microsoft fails several of those tests at today\u2019s price. \n\nIn my book, that spells a clear \u201cno.\u201d",
