  "reasoning": "First things first, Nvidia operates in the semiconductor business, and folks, that\u2019s outside my circle of competence. I\u2019m comfortable valuing a Coke or a See\u2019s Candies, but I draw the line at cutting-edge chips where technological change moves faster than a jackrabbit. While the numbers tell a story of handsome ROE (27.8%), mouthwatering operating margins (74%), and a decade of 3,148% earnings growth, I can\u2019t swear I fully grasp the cyclical swings and R&D arms race in that industry. \n\nOn moat, Nvidia shows strong historic profitability, but pricing power analysis is missing and the competitive battlefield\u2014Intel, AMD, TSMC\u2014is a fierce one. Management has delivered growth and retained earnings, but I see recent share issuance and no dividends, suggesting capital allocation isn\u2019t quite in the mold of a GEICO or a Burlington Northern. Financially, the balance sheet is solid with moderate debt, yet tech firms pack hidden risks in inventory, supply chains, and scaling up fabs. \n\nMost importantly, the stock trades at almost ten times my conservative intrinsic value estimate (negative margin of safety of 89%), which violates my rule: \"Pay a fair price for a terrific business.\" Long term, AI may prove lucrative, but I\u2019d rather own a simple, predictable business. Compared to my holdings in Coca-Cola or Apple, this feels like speculating rather than investing. Therefore I\u2019m passing\u2014bearish on adding Nvidia to Berkshire\u2019s barnyard.",
