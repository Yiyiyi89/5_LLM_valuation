  "reasoning": "First things first \u2013 GOOG falls largely outside my circle of competence. I\u2019m comfortable with consumer products, banks, insurance or railroads, but I don\u2019t claim to be an expert in search algorithms, digital ad auctions or AI development. Risk comes from not knowing what you\u2019re doing, and I simply don\u2019t know this business well enough to trust my capital to it.\n\nThat said, Google does appear to have a considerable moat \u2013 its search engine benefits from network effects, immense scale and entrenched ad partnerships. It\u2019s like owning a toll bridge on the internet; once advertisers and users are on your platform, it\u2019s hard for them to switch. But knowing a moat exists and valuing it correctly are two different things when the underlying economics are so technology-driven.\n\nOn management, Sundar Pichai and the Alphabet board have delivered prodigious cash flows and maintained a fortress balance sheet, yet the data here is sparse. I can\u2019t assess their capital allocation priorities in cloud, self-driving cars or AI from the snippet you provided. I\u2019ve got no insight into share repurchases versus reinvestment decisions, so I can\u2019t give this the full Berkshire stamp of approval.\n\nFinancially, I\u2019m told Alphabet has oceans of free cash and minimal debt, but without consistent historical figures I\u2019m left guessing. I don\u2019t have an intrinsic value estimate or margin-of-safety calculation in front of me \u2013 and if I don\u2019t know the right intrinsic value, I can\u2019t know if I\u2019m paying half price or twice the price.\n\nLong-term, the prospects of digital advertising and cloud computing are exciting, but they come with regulatory risk, shifting consumer privacy standards and competition from nimble upstarts. I prefer businesses where I can predict the economics twenty years out. Here, the range of outcomes is too wide.\n\nCompared to opportunities in my portfolio \u2013 Coca-Cola, Apple, Bank of America or BNSF \u2013 this one offers less clarity and more complexity. When in doubt, the answer is usually no. So I\u2019ll pass for now. If I can\u2019t figure out the fundamentals and valuation, I\u2019m not interested, period.",
