  "reasoning": "1. Circle of Competence: I confess streaming media isn\u2019t within my circle. I\u2019ve spent my life studying simple, predictable businesses like See\u2019s Candies or Coca-Cola, and I struggle to wrap my head around shifting subscriber tastes, content costs and global licensing battles. If I don\u2019t understand it, I pass. 2. Moat: Netflix has scale and brand recognition, and its operating margins (32.9%) are impressive. But inconsistent ROE (just 3.8% last period and none above 15% in ten years) tells me that content spending keeps eating any advantage. That isn\u2019t the kind of durable moat I look for. 3. Management & Capital Allocation: Issuing stock to fund content and paying no dividends suggests management is betting on growth over returns to shareholders. That\u2019s a red flag for someone looking for disciplined capital allocation. 4. Financial Health & Consistency: A debt\u2010to\u2010equity ratio north of 1.8, patchy earnings growth (-8.7% over ten periods) and no liquidity metrics available don\u2019t inspire confidence. 5. Valuation: A three-stage DCF pegs intrinsic value at roughly $3,478 a share, yet the stock trades well above that. The margin of safety is negative. 6. Long\u2010Term Prospects: Fierce competition, huge content outlays and subscriber churn make future returns uncertain. 7. Opportunity Cost: I\u2019d rather own a smaller slice of a fortress\u2010like company I fully grasp\u2014say Coke or a regulated utility\u2014than a large stake in a business churning capital at the risk of consumer fickleness. My conclusion: I\u2019m steering clear.",
