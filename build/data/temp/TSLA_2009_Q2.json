  "reasoning": "I\u2019m going to start with the first rule of my investing: stick to what you know. The auto business \u2014 especially electric vehicles laden with high-tech R&D, battery chemistry, software updates and regulatory hurdles \u2014 lies well outside my circle of competence. I prefer simple, predictable businesses like See\u2019s Candies or Coca-Cola where I can forecast cash flows decades out. \n\nCompetitive Moat: Cars are a commodity at the end of the day. Brand loyalty exists, but you can switch from Tesla to another EV in a heartbeat. I don\u2019t see a wide, durable moat. Battery technology will commoditize, charging networks will proliferate, and deep-pocketed competitors will erode any advantage. \n\nManagement & Capital Allocation: Elon Musk is undoubtedly a visionary and great marketer, but his capital allocation has swung wildly from solar roofs to tunnels to Twitter. I like managers who act like owners, avoiding unnecessary debt and holding a steady course. Tesla\u2019s balance sheet has improved, but I don\u2019t have the confidence that earnings will be consistent or that Jack Welch-type capital discipline is in place. \n\nFinancial Health & Consistency: The auto industry is capital\u2010intensive and cyclical. I saw the same in the airline business \u2014 great when the wind is at your back, catastrophic when it\u2019s not. Tesla\u2019s profitability can swing with raw\u2010material costs, incentives and international sales. I like businesses with stable, high returns on capital. This isn\u2019t it. \n\nValuation & Intrinsic Value: With no reliable way to value Tesla\u2019s future free cash flows and no margin of safety in hand, I\u2019m flying blind. You pay a high multiple for projected growth, but the downside risk if growth disappoints is large. \n\nLong-Term Prospects & Red Flags: EV adoption will grow, but competition from legacy automakers, new entrants and regulatory shifts creates a lot of uncertainty. Maintaining pricing power amid rising incentives and discounts will pressure margins. Battery technology could tip the scales in a way that renders today\u2019s leaders obsolete. \n\nRelative to My Portfolio: I\u2019d rather own a piece of a wonderful business like Apple or Coca-Cola, selling at a sensible price, than speculate on who's going to lead a fiercely competitive, capital\u2010hungry industry. \n\nBottom line: No matter the buzz, I\u2019ll pass. I can\u2019t confidently forecast the returns or spot a durable moat. Bearish on Tesla with modest conviction until I see real, consistent evidence of competitive advantage and disciplined capital allocation.",
