  "reasoning": "First off, Tesla falls well outside my circle of competence. I\u2019ve spent my career sticking to consumer staples, insurance, railroads, banks and simple industrials\u2014businesses whose economics I can forecast a decade or more out. Carmaking, rapid\u2010paced battery technology and software updates aren\u2019t areas where I have a repeatable edge. \n\nRegarding a moat, while Tesla\u2019s operating margin of about 30% suggests some pricing power today, auto manufacturing is inherently capital intensive and fiercely competitive. Legacy auto makers and upstarts are pouring billions into EV platforms and battery technology. History tells me any edge here is likely to be fleeting. \n\nOn management, I admire Elon Musk\u2019s vision, but running an unpredictable, cash\u2010burning auto and energy empire is very different from allocating capital in a straightforward, free\u2010cash\u2010flow\u2010positive business. Tesla\u2019s reader says no significant share issuance or dividends, but its negative owner earnings of roughly $159 million and DCF implying a negative intrinsic value ($\u20131,826 per share) suggest management is still burning cash rather than generating abundant free cash flow. \n\nFinancially, the numbers raise red flags. A negative ROE (\u20136.8%), negative ROIC (\u20131.8%), debt\u2010to\u2010equity near 2.8 and wildly inconsistent earnings growth aren\u2019t the hallmarks of a financial fortress. You don\u2019t get a margin of safety when your owner earnings line is in the red and your balance sheet carries leverage. \n\nValuation only compounds the problem. A DCF that produces a deeply negative intrinsic value and a margin of safety at \u2013110% tells you the market is pricing in future profits that bear little resemblance to today\u2019s cash flows. \n\nLong term, electric vehicles may be important, but I\u2019d rather own a wonderful business at a fair price than a speculation on future maturity at a sky-high valuation. I already own Coca-Cola, Apple, BNSF (through Berkshire), and other businesses that generate steady cash and possess durable moats. \n\nIn comparing opportunities, Tesla\u2019s risk of permanent capital impairment outweighs any potential upside. When in doubt, it\u2019s usually best to say no. That\u2019s why I\u2019d pass on TSLA today.",
