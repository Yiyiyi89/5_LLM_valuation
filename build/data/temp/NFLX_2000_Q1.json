  "reasoning": "First off, NFLX falls outside my Circle of Competence. I\u2019m comfortable with businesses I can relate to\u2014consumer staples, banks, insurance, utilities\u2014where I understand the economics and the competitive landscape. Streaming video is complex, with shifting content rights, evolving technology, intense competition, and uncertain subscriber economics. I simply don\u2019t know it well enough to bet the farm.\n\nOn the moat front, streaming services face low switching costs and razor-thin moats. A viewer can cancel Netflix and hop over to Disney+, Amazon or Apple TV+. Unlike Coca-Cola\u2019s brand or See\u2019s Candies\u2019 local pricing power, Netflix\u2019s advantage is fleeting.\n\nManagement may be talented\u2014Reed Hastings has built a global subscriber base\u2014but they\u2019re in a content arms race, burning cash to acquire or produce shows. That\u2019s not the type of conservative capital allocation I admire at companies like GEICO or BNSF.\n\nFinancially, Netflix has loaded up on debt to fund content, and with zero data provided here, I\u2019m flying blind on cash flow consistency or leverage. High fixed costs and subscriber churn leave its earnings anything but consistent.\n\nWithout any reliable valuation or intrinsic value estimate, there\u2019s no margin of safety. I\u2019d be guessing at whether today\u2019s price is 10% or 100% over intrinsic value\u2014a recipe for permanent loss.\n\nLong-term, the streaming field will be cutthroat, and Netflix must keep outspending competitors just to tread water. Compared to opportunities in my portfolio\u2014from Coca-Cola\u2019s enduring brand to Apple\u2019s sticky ecosystem\u2014Netflix doesn\u2019t match up.\n\nWhen in doubt, I say no. I\u2019d rather hold wonderful businesses at fair prices than fair businesses at wonderful prices. NFLX is a fair business in a highly competitive field I don\u2019t fully grasp, with no margin of safety. I\u2019ll pass.",
