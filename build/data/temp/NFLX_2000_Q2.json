  "reasoning": "1. Circle of Competence: I\u2019ll be candid \u2013 I don\u2019t fully understand the economics of streaming media. It\u2019s not consumer staples, insurance, railroads or simple industrials in my wheelhouse. Risk comes from not knowing what you\u2019re doing, and Netflix\u2019s tech-heavy, content-spend model falls outside my circle.\n2. Competitive Moat: I look for durable advantages\u2013pricing power, brands, switching costs. Netflix has churn, rising subscriber costs and fierce competition from Disney, Amazon and others investing billions. I don\u2019t see a wide, lasting moat.\n3. Management Quality: Reed Hastings has talent and vision, but content is a perpetual arms race. Capital allocation swings between aggressive content spending and debt financing. I like managers who think like owners and avoid volatile capital needs.\n4. Financial Health: With limited data here, the story I know is heavy debt, inconsistent free cash flow and large ongoing content commitments. That doesn\u2019t fit my preference for a financial fortress.\n5. Valuation: Without reliable intrinsic\u2010value estimates, I can\u2019t say Netflix is trading at a meaningful discount. \"Price is what you pay; value is what you get.\" Here, both sides of that equation feel uncertain.\n6. Long-Term Prospects & Red Flags: Streaming will be around 20 years from now, but the economics look more cutthroat than the wide\u2010moat businesses I seek. High content costs, competitive bundling, and global regulation add more unknowns.\n7. Comparative Opportunity: I\u2019d rather own a wonderful business at a fair price\u2013say Coca-Cola or Apple\u2013than dabble in a fair one at any price. Netflix doesn\u2019t clear my bar.\nIn short, this is a no\u2013Netflix sits outside my realm, with too many unknowns and too little margin of safety.",
