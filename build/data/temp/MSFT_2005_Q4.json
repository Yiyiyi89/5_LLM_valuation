  "reasoning": "First things first, Microsoft lies well outside my circle of competence. I don\u2019t pretend to understand every twist and turn of software platforms, cloud architecture, and enterprise licensing as deeply as I do consumer staples, railroads or simple utilities. Risk comes from not knowing what you\u2019re doing, and I\u2019d be taking on unnecessary risk by diving into a highly technical business.  \n\nAs for the moat, sure, Microsoft has sturdy operating margins around 89% and a stable franchise in Windows, Office and Azure. But their ROE has been a modest 7.7% on average, with only 0 out of 10 periods exceeding 15%. That inconsistency tells me their competitive advantage can be eroded by disruptive change\u2014far different than the wide moats of Coca-Cola or See\u2019s Candies where pricing power and brand loyalty endure.  \n\nManagement has done a creditable job growing book value per share, but recent stock issuances raise questions about shareholder-friendly capital allocation. Dividends are still a drop in the bucket relative to their cash flows. I like managers who think and act like owners, and issuing new shares isn\u2019t my first choice of how to reward shareholders.  \n\nOn the balance sheet, Microsoft is conservative\u2014debt-to-equity sits below 0.5 and free cash flows are plentiful. Yet their return on invested capital is a mere 5.2%, and their earnings growth over the last ten years, while 72.7% in total, has been uneven from period to period. I prefer companies that compound earnings predictably year after year.  \n\nMost importantly, the valuation is simply too rich. Your three-stage DCF pegs intrinsic value at roughly $53,000, and even after a 15% haircut you still get $45,377. At today\u2019s price the margin of safety is negative 82.6%. As I often say, \u201cIt\u2019s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.\u201d Microsoft looks like the latter\u2014no margin of safety to be found.  \n\nLong term, I admire the franchise and the depth of the management bench. But in 20 years I\u2019d rather own businesses I clearly understand and that I can purchase at sensible levels\u2014think Coca-Cola, Apple (as a consumer play), or my insurance operations. Microsoft simply doesn\u2019t stack up against the opportunities in my portfolio when I apply my stringent criteria.  \n\nSo I\u2019ll pass\u2014there\u2019s no penalty for missing a good opportunity, only for buying at too steep a price.",
