  "reasoning": "I\u2019m going to start with my first rule: Circle of competence. I\u2019ve spent my life understanding simple, consumer-driven businesses\u2014Coca-Cola, See\u2019s Candies, insurance\u2014and frankly, the inner workings of digital advertising and search algorithms fall outside my wheelhouse. Without solid fundamentals, financials, or reliable valuation data in front of me here, I can\u2019t honestly claim to understand Google\u2019s true economic engine.\n\nThat said, from what\u2019s publicly known, Google does possess a wide moat\u2014dominant market share in search, powerful network effects, and huge data advantages that create real switching costs for advertisers. Their management has shown competence: strong free-cash-flow generation, prudent buybacks, and moonshot investments under Alphabet\u2019s umbrella. On the balance sheet front, I\u2019d expect a fortress, though I can\u2019t confirm it with the data you\u2019ve provided.\n\nWhen it comes to price, I\u2019m a simple soul: \u2018\u2018Price is what you pay; value is what you get.\u2019\u2019 Without an intrinsic value estimate or margin of safety, I can\u2019t say whether today\u2019s price leaves room to sleep well at night. And in my portfolio, I\u2019d sooner buy a wonderful business at a fair price than a fair business at a wonderful price.\n\nLong term, Google\u2019s prospects in AI and cloud look interesting, but the field is changing fast, regulatory headwinds loom, and I see plenty of unknowns. Compared to the straightforward economics of a Coke or a GEICO, this one\u2019s too fuzzy.\n\nSo I\u2019ll pass\u2014neither bullish nor bearish\u2014until I understand the story better and see a real margin of safety. I\u2019d rather wait on the sidelines than risk permanent impairment of capital on something outside my circle.",
