  "reasoning": "First off, Microsoft falls well outside my circle of competence. I\u2019ve spent my life investing in simple, predictable businesses\u2014Coca-Cola, See\u2019s Candies, GEICO\u2014and while I admire Microsoft\u2019s scale, I don\u2019t profess to fully understand the ins and outs of cloud computing or enterprise software the way I understand railroads or consumer staples. \n\nWhen it comes to competitive moats, Microsoft certainly exhibits pricing power in Windows and Azure, reflected in its 86.7% average operating margin and 77.7% revenue stability. But the moat is technology-driven\u2014subject to rapid change and fierce competition\u2014so it carries more risk than the wide, enduring moats I prize in consumer goods and utilities. Its ROE of only 3.9% over the last 10 periods, with no single year above 15%, tells me the returns aren\u2019t as robust or consistent as I\u2019d like for a fortress business. \n\nManagement under Satya Nadella has done a credible job steering the ship into the cloud era, but recent stock issuance hints at dilution, and with no material dividend, capital allocation lacks the clear, shareholder-friendly track record I see at companies like Berkshire\u2019s BNSF or Coca-Cola. \n\nOn the balance sheet, debt levels are modest and margins are high, yet earnings growth has been lumpy\u20143921.5% over ten periods sounds big until you dig into the inconsistencies. Owner earnings of $2.6 billion are solid, but a three-stage DCF pegs intrinsic value closer to $32,700 per share after a 15% haircut. The current market price sits well above that, giving a margin of safety of -88.6%. That\u2019s the deal-breaker. \n\nIn the long run, Microsoft may remain a leader, but I\u2019d rather own a wonderful business at a fair price than a fair business at a wonderful price. Compared to the opportunities I see in staples, insurance, railroads, or even Apple, Microsoft is simply too richly valued and too far outside my sweet spot. My answer here is no.",
