  "reasoning": "1. Circle of Competence: I\u2019ve spent 60\u2009years avoiding complex technology businesses except where they behave like consumer products (think Apple). Google\u2019s search, advertising and cloud services are far outside my circle. \n2. Moat Assessment: While the network effect of search and the scale of ad revenue suggest some competitive edge, I have insufficient data here to conclude it\u2019s a durable economic moat. \n3. Management Quality: Sundar Pichai and the Alphabet board have demonstrated strong stewardship, but with no hard numbers on capital allocation or share repurchases provided, I\u2019m flying blind. \n4. Financial Health: There\u2019s zero data on balance-sheet strength, earnings consistency or debt levels in the materials provided. I can\u2019t call it a fortress without seeing the bricks and mortar. \n5. Valuation & Intrinsic Value: With no reliable intrinsic value estimate, margin of safety or trading multiples, I can\u2019t tell if I\u2019d be paying a sensible price. \n6. Long-Term Prospects & Red Flags: Google\u2019s leadership in AI and data is impressive, but rapid technology change and regulatory scrutiny pose risks I don\u2019t fully grasp. \n7. Relative to My Portfolio: I\u2019d rather own a simpler business\u2014a Coca-Cola or a Berkshire-style railroad\u2014that I understand in and out. \nConclusion: When I don\u2019t understand a business and lack the data, the answer is usually \u201cno.\u201d I\u2019m passing for now.",
