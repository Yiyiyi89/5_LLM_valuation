  "reasoning": "First off, Apple falls squarely in my circle of competence \u2013 it\u2019s a consumer products business with a powerful ecosystem and brand, much like Coke in my portfolio. Now, let me tell you what I see in the numbers provided. The moat is real \u2013 Apple\u2019s sticky ecosystem, pricing power and brand loyalty give it durable advantages. Operating margins near 49% are the envy of most businesses. But I\u2019ve always said, \u2018\u2018You pay a high price for a silver medal.\u2019\u2019 \n\nManagement has done a fine job building the franchise, but the data here flags recent stock issuance and minimal dividends, which runs counter to my preference for shareholder-friendly capital allocation. I\u2019d rather see consistent buybacks or rising dividends instead of potential dilution. \n\nOn financial health, the balance sheet is conservative \u2013 debt-to-equity under 0.5 and strong cash flows \u2013 but the return on equity of 11.3% and ROIC of 7.7% leave me wanting more. I like to see returns north of 15% on equity. Earnings growth has also been erratic, even if cumulative growth over ten periods was 244%. Consistency matters to me, and the lack of a reliable track record gives me pause. \n\nThen there\u2019s valuation. A three-stage DCF pegs conservative intrinsic value at about $153,000 per share against a sky-high market cap, producing a negative margin of safety of roughly 67%. I\u2019m not interested in overpaying, no matter how wonderful the business. My mantra is \u2018\u2018It\u2019s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.\u2019\u2019 \n\nLong term, I have no doubts Apple will keep churning out great products, but at today\u2019s price, there\u2019s simply no margin of safety. Compared to opportunities in our portfolio \u2013 think Coca-Cola at attractive yields or GEICO\u2019s underwriting \u2013 Apple doesn\u2019t offer the same risk-reward. So, for now, I\u2019ll sit on the sidelines and let the price come down before I\u2019m willing to pull the trigger.",
