  "reasoning": "1. Circle of Competence: I\u2019ve spent my life sticking to what I understand\u2014consumer brands, insurance, railroads\u2014digital advertising and search algorithms aren\u2019t in my wheelhouse. With the data here coming in at zero, I can\u2019t get comfortable.\n2. Moat: Google\u2019s scale and search dominance suggest a moat, but without reliable metrics it\u2019s like judging a horse by its shadow. I need clear ad-revenue trends or switching costs numbers before I give a thumbs up.\n3. Management: Larry and Sergey built something remarkable and Sundar Pichai seems capable, but the analysis offers no insight into their capital-allocation discipline or regulatory risk management.\n4. Financial Health: No balance sheet, no earnings consistency, no debt ratios\u2014just blank stares. I\u2019d need at least a decade of cash-flow history.\n5. Valuation: Intrinsic value is nil when data is nil. I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s selling at $1 or $1,000 a share relative to what it\u2019s worth.\n6. Long-term Prospects: Search and cloud could be winners for decades, but red flags loom in antitrust scrutiny and fast-changing tech. Without more detail, it\u2019s a wild guess.\n7. Opportunity Cost: I\u2019d rather own a wonderful business like Coca-Cola or See\u2019s Candies at a fair price than speculate blind on Google. In this case, I\u2019ll sit on my hands until I see a more complete picture.",
