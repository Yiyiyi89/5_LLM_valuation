  "reasoning": "1. Circle of Competence: I\u2019ve spent my life avoiding complex semiconductor businesses. Nvidia\u2019s GPU and AI chip operations lie well outside my circle of competence. As I\u2019ve said, \u201cRisk comes from not knowing what you\u2019re doing,\u201d and I don\u2019t claim to understand the ins and outs of GPU architectures and AI moats as well as I do consumer staples or insurance. \n\n2. Competitive Moat: While Nvidia shows strong operating margins (69%) suggesting pricing power, its track record on return on equity is spotty\u20140 out of 10 periods above 15%. A durable moat requires consistency, and inconsistent ROE undermines confidence that this advantage will persist in a rapidly evolving industry. \n\n3. Management Quality: The recent common stock issuance raises a flag on capital allocation; I like managers who think like owners and avoid dilution. The lack of a dividend also means shareholders rely solely on share buybacks for returns. Compared to the disciplined teams at Coca-Cola or See\u2019s Candies, I don\u2019t see that same shareholder orientation. \n\n4. Financial Health & Consistency: A debt-to-equity of 0.7 and a modest return on invested capital (6%) are less comforting than the fortress balance sheets I prefer. Earnings growth is erratic, and operating cycles in semis can be brutal. Inconsistency works against my principle of predictable, understandable businesses. \n\n5. Valuation vs. Intrinsic Value: The three-stage DCF pegs conservative intrinsic value at roughly $33,154 per share equivalent, yet the market cap of $555 billion implies a margin of safety of \u201394%. I\u2019d rather wait for a business I truly understand than try to time a turnaround in a richly priced, technical name. \n\n6. Long-Term Prospects & Red Flags: Technology changes rapidly. Today\u2019s king can be tomorrow\u2019s pawn; that uncertainty is a red flag to me. I\u2019d rather own something that will still be prospering in 20 years without needing me to predict the next AI model cycle. \n\n7. Relative Opportunity: We hold Apple in Berkshire because I view it as a consumer franchise with an ecosystem moat I understand, not as a pure tech play. Compared to the likes of Coca-Cola or BNSF, Nvidia is a high-stakes game of musical chairs in chip fabs. I\u2019ll pass and wait for something simpler, with honest management, a durable moat, and sensible valuation. \n\nIn sum, this is a no from Omaha. I\u2019d rather own a wonderful business at a fair price than a complex one at any price.",
