  "confidence": 0.9,
  "reasoning": "First things first, Netflix lies outside my Circle of Competence. I understand Coca-Cola bottles and insurance policies, but streaming content and subscriber churn? That\u2019s a world of rapidly shifting consumer tastes and technology\u2014risk comes from not knowing what you\u2019re doing. \n\n1. Circle of Competence: This is a content-creation and technology business facing constant platform and rights negotiations. I don\u2019t fully grasp its future competitive dynamics. \n\n2. Economic Moat: Operating margins look healthy at 61%, but that reflects huge spending on original programming, not durable pricing power. Competitors like Disney+, Amazon and Apple are muscling in. I see no wide, deep moat. \n\n3. Management Quality: Reed Hastings has been innovative, but negative owner earnings of \u2013$55M and high debt\u2010to\u2010equity at 0.61 suggest aggressive capital outlays. I like owners who generate cash for shareholders, not burn it on bidding wars for content rights. \n\n4. Financial Health: ROE of 3.6% and ROIC of 2.2% are weak; inconsistent earnings growth; no current ratio data; negative intrinsic value in DCF. It\u2019s like watching someone pour water into a bucket with a hole. \n\n5. Valuation: A three\u2010stage DCF yields a conservative intrinsic value of \u2013$850/share and a margin of safety around \u2013250%. You\u2019re paying a huge premium for uncertain future profits. \n\n6. Long-Term Prospects & Red Flags: Streaming is fast-changing, high-burn, heavy competition. Content costs keep rising. Subscriber fatigue could set in. \n\n7. Portfolio Comparison: I\u2019d rather own a Coca-Cola, Apple or Bank of America\u2014businesses with proven moats, reliable free cash flow and managers who think like owners. \n\nIn sum, I\u2019d say bearish with about 90% conviction. There\u2019s no penalty for missed opportunities, but plenty for permanent capital loss.",
