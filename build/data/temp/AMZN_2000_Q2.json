  "reasoning": "First, I\u2019ll start with the most important question: do I understand Amazon well enough to invest? In my view, the massive e-commerce operation and the rapidly evolving cloud business are outside my circle of competence. I\u2019m comfortable with simple consumer products that customers keep buying\u2014Coke, See\u2019s Candies, Apple\u2019s iPhone ecosystem\u2014but the inner workings of global logistics and cloud platforms are too complex for me to call a margin of safety.\n\nOn competitive moats, Amazon certainly has scale advantages and a strong brand, but I don\u2019t have sufficient data to gauge how durable that advantage will be 10 or 20 years out, especially with razor-thin pricing and investment in new ventures.\n\nManagement under Bezos and now Jassy has shown the willingness to reinvest almost every dollar of profit back into growing the business. That aggressive capital allocation has driven impressive ROE of 113.9% and healthy operating margins of 27%. But on the flip side, ROIC is reported negative, and I lack confidence in the consistency of those returns when all the debt and equity adjustments are considered.\n\nFinancially, Amazon shows conservative debt levels, but I can\u2019t see a reliable current ratio or historical earnings consistency here. Intrinsic value? Without a dependable cash-flow pattern or book-value benchmarks, I can\u2019t arrive at a reliable estimate or margin of safety.\n\nLong-term, Amazon will almost certainly still be around\u2014but that alone doesn\u2019t make it a great Buffett purchase. When I weigh this idea against the likes of Coca-Cola or Apple\u2014businesses with clear moats, predictable cash streams, honest capital allocation, and valuations I can grasp\u2014I have to pass.\n\nIn short, I\u2019m neutral on AMZN. It may be a wonderful business in its own right, but it sits outside my comfort zone, and I simply can\u2019t calculate a margin of safety. I\u2019ll wait for opportunities where I can say with confidence: I understand this business, I see a durable advantage, and I\u2019m getting it at the right price.",
