  "reasoning": "First off, I\u2019ve spent my life sticking to businesses I can wrap my mind around, and Microsoft\u2019s sprawling enterprise software, cloud services and platform plays are outside my circle of competence. I know consumer products and simple banks, not the inner workings of Azure or SQL Server economics.\n\nOn the moat front, Microsoft has strong market share\u2014its 83% operating margin suggests some pricing power\u2014but ROE has been uneven with only one out of ten years above 15%. That tells me the moat, while real, isn\u2019t quite the wide, enduring trench I look for the way Coca-Cola\u2019s brand is.\n\nManagement is competent and shareholder-friendly in many ways, but a recent stock issuance and minimal dividends raise my eyebrows. I want managers who think like owners and consistently return capital when there\u2019s nothing better to buy.\n\nFinancially, the business shows high operating margins and scale, but debt to equity near 0.9 and return on invested capital under 6% give me pause. Earnings growth has been lumpy over ten periods despite a 97% total gain, and consistency is something I prize\u2014just ask See\u2019s Candies.\n\nValuation is the clincher. Even with a generous DCF, the shares trade nearly 70% above my conservative intrinsic value. \u2018\u2018Price is what you pay; value is what you get,\u2019\u2019 and right now there\u2019s no margin of safety.\n\nLong-term, Microsoft may prosper, but I\u2019d rather own a wonderful consumer or financial business at a fair price than a tech giant at a stretch. I see better risk-reward in names I understand\u2014Coca-Cola, Apple or my favorite banks\u2014where the moat, management and pricing all align with my playbook.\n\nSo, no thank you. I\u2019ll pass and wait for an opportunity I can grasp with a proper margin of safety.",
