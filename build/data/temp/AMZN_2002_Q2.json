  "confidence": 1.0,
  "reasoning": "1. Circle of Competence: I don\u2019t understand Amazon the way I understand Coca-Cola or BNSF. It\u2019s a hybrid of retail, logistics, hardware and cloud computing\u2014a complex web well outside my circle. As I\u2019ve said, \u201cRisk comes from not knowing what you\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\n2. Moat: While Amazon has scale and technology advantages, its ROE is spotty (only 4 of 9 periods above 15%) and its pricing power is unclear. A real economic moat should show up in consistent returns on capital. Amazon\u2019s inconsistency tells me its competitive edge isn\u2019t as durable as, say, See\u2019s Candies\u2019 brand or Apple\u2019s ecosystem.\n\n3. Management: Jeff Bezos and team reinvest heavily, and I respect their discipline on share issuance\u2014no big dilution here. But the lack of dividends or clear owner-earnings guidance leaves me wishing for management that pays shareholders directly or shows clearer capital-allocation choices. That\u2019s not how we run the business at Berkshire.\n\n4. Financial Health: Operating margins look healthy near 30%, but ROIC is negative and owner earnings are negative $94 million per the DCF. Inconsistent earnings growth and uneven returns worry me. I prefer predictable earnings and a fortress balance sheet\u2014Amazon\u2019s numbers don\u2019t inspire that comfort.\n\n5. Valuation: The three-stage DCF spits out a negative intrinsic value and a margin of safety well below zero. Even if I trusted the assumptions, paying up for an overvalued business is the fastest way to lose money. We\u2019ve learned over decades that price discipline is paramount.\n\n6. Long-Term Prospects: E-commerce and cloud will be around, but competition is relentless and technology shifts fast. I\u2019d rather own a business I can forecast 20 years out\u2014Amazon\u2019s future profits are too hard to predict reliably.\n\n7. Comparison: I\u2019d instead deploy capital into Coca-Cola\u2019s steady cash flow, Apple\u2019s sticky ecosystem, or our insurance operations. As I always say, I\u2019d rather own a wonderful business at a fair price than a fair business at a wonderful price. Amazon doesn\u2019t fit that bill for me today.",
