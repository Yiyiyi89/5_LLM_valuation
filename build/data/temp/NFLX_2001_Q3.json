  "reasoning": "First things first, Netflix falls outside my circle of competence. I\u2019ve built my record sticking to businesses I thoroughly understand\u2014simple economics, strong brands and predictable cash flows. Streaming media is a complex, rapidly evolving business model with shifting content costs, technology platforms and fierce competition. \n\n1. Circle of Competence:  It\u2019s not in my wheelhouse. I don\u2019t have enough conviction in subscriber dynamics, licensing arrangements or global rollout costs to gauge long-term returns. That alone is a deal-breaker under my first rule: if I don\u2019t understand it, I don\u2019t invest.\n\n2. Competitive Moat:  Netflix has scale, a strong brand and original content, but the moat is under siege. Disney+, HBO Max, Amazon Prime and deep-pocketed players can outbid or bundle. Switching costs for customers are low\u2014subscribers can cancel as easily as they sign up.\n\n3. Management Quality:  Reed Hastings and Ted Sarandos have shown creativity and growth-driven capital allocation, but content spending has soared without proof of long-term margin sustainability. I prefer managers who generate cash rather than burn through it chasing market share.\n\n4. Financial Health & Consistency:  With the data given, there\u2019s insufficient information about margins, debt levels or free cash flow. Historical consistency matters to me\u2014Netflix\u2019s path to steady FCF remains uncertain.\n\n5. Valuation vs. Intrinsic Value:  No reliable intrinsic value estimate is provided. Without clear earnings power or free-cash-flow forecasts, I cannot assess a margin of safety.\n\n6. Long-Term Prospects & Red Flags:  The streaming space promises growth, but it promises heavy spending and price wars, too. I worry about content inflation and margin compression over the next decade.\n\n7. Comparison to My Portfolio:  I\u2019d rather own Coca-Cola with its resilient brand, Apple for its ecosystem lock-in, or See\u2019s Candies with durable pricing power than a speculative media platform whose economics I don\u2019t fully grasp.\n\nIn short, this isn\u2019t a place for my money\u2014or my time\u2014until I see clear economics and a rock-solid moat. Right now, I pass.",
