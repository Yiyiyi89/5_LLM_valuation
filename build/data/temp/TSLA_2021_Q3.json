  "reasoning": "First, Tesla is well outside my Circle of Competence. I don\u2019t understand the full complexity of EV batteries, autopilot software and the regulatory maze around software-driven vehicles, so I wouldn\u2019t bet the farm on it. Second, its moat is questionable. While Tesla enjoys brand recognition and some network effects on charging, its ROE has averaged just 5.7% and only a handful of quarters with double-digit returns\u2014hardly the durable pricing power I look for in a business like Coca-Cola or Apple. Third, management and capital allocation raise flags. Elon Musk has proven visionary but also prone to distractions, and Tesla\u2019s debt-to-equity sits around 1.0 with negative owner earnings, unlike the fortress balance sheets I prize at Berkshire. Fourth, financial health and consistency fall short. Earnings growth is erratic, operating margins strong but volatile, and the model yields a negative intrinsic value\u2014over a $16,000 haircut on a three-stage DCF with no margin of safety. Fifth, valuation is absurdly stretched. A negative intrinsic value and negative owner earnings tell me the market has priced in unicorn growth rather than sober fundamentals. Finally, long-term prospects are buried under execution risk, competitive pressure from legacy automakers, and capital-intensive demands. Compared to dependable businesses like Coca-Cola or See\u2019s Candies\u2014where I can read the tea leaves\u2014Tesla simply doesn\u2019t measure up. When in doubt, I say no, and Tesla\u2019s an easy pass.",
