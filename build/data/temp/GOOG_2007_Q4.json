  "reasoning": "First off, Google (Alphabet) sits firmly in the realm of complex technology and digital advertising\u2014outside my Circle of Competence. As I always say, \u201cRisk comes from not knowing what you\u2019re doing,\u201d and I don\u2019t fully understand the nuances of auction\u2010based ad markets, AI development or the shifting regulatory environment around user data. \n\nOn a moat, Google likely enjoys a network effect in search and strong data assets, but without the details I can\u2019t judge its durability. Tech competition, antitrust risks and changes in consumer behavior could erode that lead. \n\nManagement looks capable, yet the firm\u2019s habit of funding long-term moonshot projects\u2014many of which may never pay off\u2014doesn\u2019t align with my preference for disciplined capital allocation focused on clear, predictable returns. \n\nWe have no financial or valuation data here\u2014no balance sheet figures, earnings history or reliable intrinsic\u2010value estimate\u2014so I can\u2019t assess margin of safety. \n\nLong term, the business model faces regulatory headwinds and rapidly shifting ad landscapes. Given all this uncertainty and the lack of information, I\u2019d rather allocate capital to companies I comprehend deeply\u2014like Coca-Cola, Apple in its consumer-products guise or Burlington Northern Santa Fe\u2014than take a guess here. \n\nIn short: no investment for me until I understand Google\u2019s economics in granular detail and see a clear margin of safety. \u201cWhen in doubt, the answer is usually \u2018no.\u2019\u201d",
