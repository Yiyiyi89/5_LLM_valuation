  "reasoning": "Well, first things first: I don\u2019t really know search-engine and digital-ad businesses as well as I know Coca-Cola or See\u2019s Candies. That\u2019s outside my circle of competence, and as I\u2019ve often said, \u201cRisk comes from not knowing what you\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nOn the moat front, Google is clearly the 800-pound gorilla in search and online advertising. It benefits from network effects and massive scale, but those aren\u2019t the durable, consumer-product moats I love. Pricing power is more limited in ad markets than in ketchup or toothpaste.\n\nManagement under Sundar Pichai appears honest and long-term oriented. Alphabet hoards cash, buys back shares and has shown good capital allocation discipline. But I\u2019ve never spent enough time digging into the boardroom dynamics to be confident they think exactly like owners.\n\nFinancially, Google is a fortress with little debt, loads of free cash flow and consistent earnings. But our data here is blank \u2013 we\u2019ve got no real numbers to test intrinsic value or margin of safety.\n\nWithout a reliable valuation, I can\u2019t tell if the stock is cheap relative to what the business will generate in 10 or 20 years. And in fast-moving tech fields, what seems cutting-edge today can be old hat tomorrow.\n\nLong term, Alphabet is well positioned in AI, cloud and search, but regulation, competition and rapid change leave me uneasy. When I compare this to owning proven brands like Coca-Cola or Apple in my portfolio, I\u2019d rather sit on cash than guess on the numbers I don\u2019t see.\n\nSo the answer here is a courteous no \u2013 or as I\u2019d call it, a neutral stance. There are no penalties for missing an opportunity; the only sin is permanent loss of capital, and I don\u2019t want to commit funds when I don\u2019t fully understand the story.",
