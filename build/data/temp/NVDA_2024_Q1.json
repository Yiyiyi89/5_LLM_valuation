  "reasoning": "First, I\u2019ll say right off the bat that semiconductors are outside my circle of competence. I understand consumer products, insurance, banks, utilities and railroads\u2014not cutting-edge GPU design. As I\u2019ve said, \u201cRisk comes from not knowing what you\u2019re doing,\u201d so I\u2019d rather sit this one out.\n\nOn the moat front, Nvidia certainly has technological leadership in AI chips and strong operating margins\u201479.9% last period and a 10-year average near 69.5%\u2014which reads like pricing power. But you don\u2019t build an enduring consumer franchise on bits and transistors the way you do with Coca-Cola or See\u2019s Candies. The competitive edge here could erode with the next architectural leap or a rival\u2019s breakthrough.\n\nManagement has deployed capital aggressively in R&D and raised equity recently, diluting current holders and paying no dividends. I respect smart capital allocation, but issuing stock at stratospheric valuations feels more like momentum chasing than owner-oriented stewardship.\n\nFinancially, Nvidia sports a tidy ROE of 30.3% and solid returns on invested capital, but earnings growth has been uneven\u2014only four out of the last ten years above 15% ROE\u2014and current liquidity ratios aren\u2019t provided. Consistency matters to me, and the roller-coaster earnings give me pause.\n\nValuation is where the bell rings loudest: the three-stage DCF pegs intrinsic value per share at roughly $227,900 after a conservative haircut versus a market cap of $1.8 trillion. You\u2019re paying well above intrinsic\u2014you get a margin of safety of \u201387%. That\u2019s not paying a fair price for a wonderful business; it\u2019s the opposite.\n\nLooking out 20 years, AI is exciting, but history teaches that edge in complex tech often vanishes quickly. I\u2019d prefer to deploy capital in something I deeply understand and can hold forever. Compared to Coca-Cola\u2019s predictable cash flows or BNSF\u2019s durable moat, Nvidia is a no-go for me.\n\nIn summary, it\u2019s outside my circle, the valuation is exorbitant, and the long-term picture carries too many unknowns. I\u2019ll pass.",
