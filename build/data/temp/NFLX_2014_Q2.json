  "reasoning": "1. Circle of Competence: I\u2019m loath to buy businesses I don\u2019t fully understand, and Netflix sits at the intersection of content creation, technology platforms, and fierce global competition\u2014outside my circle of competence.  \n\n2. Competitive Moat: While Netflix has shown strong operating margins (32.7% last period), its ROE has never exceeded 15% in any of the last ten years. That tells me pricing power exists, but no enduring moat protects it from Disney+, Amazon, HBO Max and others.  \n\n3. Management & Capital Allocation: Reed Hastings is creative, but funding massive new content with a debt-to-equity ratio near 2.9 is risky. Unlike the disciplined capital allocators at See\u2019s Candies or GEICO, Netflix\u2019s growth comes at the expense of financial leverage.  \n\n4. Financial Health & Consistency: A weak ROE of 4.4%, high debt levels, inconsistent earnings growth and no reliable current ratio data point to a shaky financial foundation. Consistency is the name of the game, and Netflix\u2019s record is spotty.  \n\n5. Valuation vs. Intrinsic Value: My three-stage DCF pegs fair value (with a 15% haircut) at about $854 a share. At current market prices, there\u2019s effectively a \u201396% margin of safety. Paying double what I believe a business is worth flies in the face of \u2018price is what you pay; value is what you get.\u2019  \n\n6. Long-Term Prospects & Red Flags: Streaming economics are subject to subscriber churn, rising content costs and shifting consumer tastes. I don\u2019t see a durable franchise that will prosper for 20 or 30 years.  \n\n7. Comparison to My Portfolio: I\u2019d rather own Coca-Cola or Apple\u2014companies with fortress balance sheets, decades-long moats and capital-allocating management\u2014for similar or better returns. Netflix doesn\u2019t join that company.  \n\nConclusion: Outside my wheelhouse, overleveraged and pricily valued\u2014my verdict is a clear \u2018no.\u2019",
