  "reasoning": "1. Circle of Competence: I\u2019ve spent 60 years investing in simple businesses I understand\u2014soft drinks, insurance, railroads, banks\u2014so I\u2019ll be the first to admit Netflix lies outside my wheelhouse. Movie and series streaming involves complex content economics, shifting licensing, and cut-throat competition. That\u2019s not where I play.\n\n2. Competitive Moat: Netflix shows strong operating margins (\u224857%) but its ROE of 3.6% and ROIC of 2.4% are paltry, and earnings have fallen 21.5% over ten periods. A real wide moat should deliver consistent double-digit returns on capital\u2014this model hasn\u2019t.\n\n3. Management & Capital Allocation: Reed Hastings may be a visionary, but negative owner earnings (\u2013$77/share) and a hopeless DCF intrinsic value (-$719/share) tell me they\u2019re burning cash to buy growth, not returns. No dividends or buybacks, just ever-greater content spend financed by debt.\n\n4. Financial Health & Consistency: Debt/equity is moderate at 0.47, but inconsistent earnings, negative free cash flow, and an unknown liquidity picture leave too many unanswered questions.\n\n5. Valuation vs. Intrinsic Value: A three-stage DCF yields a negative intrinsic value\u2014even after a 15% haircut there\u2019s no margin of safety. I won\u2019t pay for losses with hopes of future profits.\n\n6. Long-Term Prospects & Red Flags: Content costs keep rising, competition from Disney+, Amazon, HBO Max is fierce, and subscriber growth cycles. That\u2019s a treadmill game, not a cigar-butt bargain.\n\n7. Opportunity Cost: I\u2019d rather deploy capital in Coca-Cola\u2019s brand moat, Apple\u2019s ecosystem, BNSF\u2019s rail network\u2014businesses with proven pricing power, consistent cash flow, and durable advantages. In short, Netflix fails every step of my checklist.",
