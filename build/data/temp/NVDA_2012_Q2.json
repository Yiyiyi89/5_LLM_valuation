  "reasoning": "First, Nvidia lies well outside my circle of competence. I\u2019m a fan of simple, predictable businesses\u2014Coca-Cola, See\u2019s Candies, BNSF\u2014not high-velocity semiconductors that face rapid product cycles and shifting architectures. Second, while Nvidia boasts strong operating margins (~57%), its return on equity (2.7%) and return on invested capital (~2%) are spotty, and it hasn\u2019t delivered the 15%+ ROE consistency that signals a durable moat like a truly entrenched brand or infrastructure franchise. Third, management hasn\u2019t paid dividends or built a history of reliable capital allocation in the mold of GEICO or Apple\u2019s buybacks, and owner earnings have been volatile. Fourth, financial health is mixed: debt levels are conservative, but inconsistent earnings growth (\u201313.5% over 10 periods) and uneven cash flow keep me uneasy. Fifth, valuation is far above my estimate of intrinsic value (conservative IV ~$779 vs. market cap implying a 90% premium), leaving no margin of safety\u2014\u2018Price is what you pay, value is what you get.\u2019 Sixth, long-term prospects hinge on AI hype and chip cycles, not the predictable toll roads or utility-like earnings I prefer. Finally, compared with opportunities in my portfolio\u2014great consumer franchises or simple industrials trading at sensible multiples\u2014Nvidia simply doesn\u2019t meet my criteria. I\u2019d rather pass and wait for a business I fully understand at a fair price.",
