  "reasoning": "1. Circle of Competence: Amazon strays far from the businesses I understand best\u2014simple consumer products, insurance, railroads\u2014not the complexities of cloud computing, last-mile logistics and razor-thin retail pricing. As I\u2019ve said, \u201cRisk comes from not knowing what you\u2019re doing,\u201d and I can\u2019t claim mastery here.\n\n2. Moat: While AWS gives Amazon some scale advantage and roughly 26% operating margins hint at pricing power, the moat isn\u2019t as durable as Coca-Cola\u2019s or Apple\u2019s ecosystem. Return on equity has been above 15% in only 5 of the last 10 years, and earnings growth has been inconsistent.\n\n3. Management & Capital Allocation: Bezos, now Jassy, are visionary builders, but shareholder dilution via equity issuance and reinvestment in low-return ventures concern me. There\u2019s no dividend and limited share buybacks relative to cash flow.\n\n4. Financial Health & Consistency: A debt-to-equity ratio north of 6 is worrisome. Return on invested capital clocks in around 2%, and earnings growth over 10 periods is flat. You don\u2019t see that kind of volatility in GEICO or See\u2019s Candies.\n\n5. Valuation vs. Intrinsic Value: The three-stage DCF pegs a conservative intrinsic value near $1,046 per share. Today\u2019s price comes in well above that\u2014margin of safety is deeply negative. Pay attention: \u201cPrice is what you pay, value is what you get.\u201d Right now, we\u2019re paying too much.\n\n6. Long-Term Prospects & Red Flags: AWS could continue growing, and Prime membership may lock in customers, but regulatory scrutiny, intense competition and relentless capital spending add risk. I prefer businesses that will thrive with minimal fuss for decades.\n\n7. Comparison to My Portfolio: I\u2019d rather own Coca-Cola at a fair price or Apple\u2014where I understand the consumer economics\u2014than Amazon at today\u2019s valuation. When in doubt, I say no. There\u2019s no penalty for missed opportunities, only for permanent loss of capital.",
