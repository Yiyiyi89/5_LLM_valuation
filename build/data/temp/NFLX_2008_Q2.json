  "reasoning": "1. Circle of Competence: I\u2019ll start by saying streaming video is not something I\u2019ve ever understood from the ground up.  My circle of competence revolves around simple, consumer\u2010oriented franchises with durable pricing power\u2014things like Coca-Cola or See\u2019s Candies\u2014not content-production businesses burning cash on expensive shows.  If I don\u2019t understand the economic model cold, I won\u2019t bet the farm.\n\n2. Moat Assessment: Netflix has built scale and a brand, but scale in content often attracts fierce rivals with deeper pockets\u2014tech giants, studios and cable incumbents.  High operating margins (34%) today don\u2019t guarantee those margins won\u2019t erode when everyone from Disney to Amazon plays the same game.  I see no durable, unbreachable moat.\n\n3. Management & Capital Allocation: Reed Hastings and his team have been ingenious at building subscriber growth, but they\u2019ve repeatedly tapped the equity markets (common stock issuance) to fund ever-rising content costs.  As Berkshire shareholders, we like managers who think like owners and refrain from diluting the base.  Minimal dividends here offer little comfort.\n\n4. Financial Health & Consistency: Netflix shows some bright spots\u2014strong operating margins and steady book\u2010value growth\u2014but weak ROE (6.8%), low ROIC (~4.1%), a debt/equity ratio of 0.66 and spotty earnings consistency give me pause.  A fortress balance sheet should provide consistent cashflow and low leverage; this one leans heavily on borrowed funds.\n\n5. Valuation vs. Intrinsic Value: Your DCF pegs intrinsic value around $118 per share after a 15% haircut, yet the stock trades well north of that.  A negative margin of safety (~-93%) tells me I\u2019m paying too much today for uncertain returns tomorrow.  I\u2019d rather wait for a price that offers real downside protection.\n\n6. Long-Term Prospects & Red Flags: The content arms race requires perpetual spending, and customer churn can flare up quickly when competitors undercut price or bundle services.  That\u2019s a far cry from the straightforward economics of a franchise business where increased scale allows price increases without losing customers.\n\n7. Opportunity Cost: I\u2019d rather own a wonderful business like Coca-Cola at a fair price than Netflix at any price today.  In my view, Netflix is outside my comfort zone, lacks a durable moat and sits well above a sensible intrinsic value.  My verdict: I\u2019m out.",
