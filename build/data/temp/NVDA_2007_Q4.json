  "reasoning": "I\u2019ll pass on NVDA because it sits outside my circle of competence \u2013 I\u2019m not comfortable with the rapid\u2010fire world of semiconductors and AI. While Nvidia can boast strong operating margins (46%) and has shown some pricing power, its ROE has been lackluster (only about 9.8%), earnings have been uneven, and management has issued stock rather than returning cash to shareholders. The business is certainly innovative, but it faces relentless technological change and fierce competition, which undermines a durable moat in my view. Financially, debt levels look conservative, but inconsistency in returns on capital and missing current ratio data add uncertainty. Valuation is the last straw \u2013 a discounted cash flow pegs intrinsic value near $2,500, yet the stock trades far above that, leaving no margin of safety. Compared to owning a wonderful business like Coca-Cola at a sensible price or Apple in its consumer ecosystem, Nvidia simply doesn\u2019t fit the profile. I\u2019ll stick to what I know and say \u2018no\u2019 here.",
