  "reasoning": "Well, I\u2019ve looked at a lot of businesses over the last 60-plus years, and I\u2019m happiest when I stay within my circle of competence. Streaming video strikes me as a complex, fast-changing tech world\u2014lots of competition, huge content costs and razor-thin moats. That\u2019s not Coca-Cola or BNSF, and frankly I\u2019d rather watch from the sidelines.\n\n1. Circle of Competence: I don\u2019t fully grasp the economics of content creation, subscriber churn, and tech platform dynamics. If I don\u2019t understand a business, I don\u2019t invest\u2014simple as that.\n\n2. Moat: Netflix has a strong brand and early mover advantage, but its moat looks more like a trench full of water than an 18-inch concrete wall. Disney+, Amazon Prime, HBO Max and a dozen others are all pouring content in behind it.\n\n3. Management & Capital Allocation: Hastings and company have been bold, but they\u2019ve financed growth with enormous debt and licensing deals. Bold capital spending isn\u2019t always wise allocation when the return is uncertain.\n\n4. Financial Health: Without clear data here on cash flow and debt levels, we can\u2019t say it has the fortress balance sheet we prize\u2014no margin for error if streaming economics weaken.\n\n5. Valuation: There\u2019s no reliable intrinsic value worked out here. In my experience, if you can\u2019t pin down what a business is worth, you shouldn\u2019t be tempted by its price.\n\n6. Long-Term Prospects: Streaming will be around, but the economics are shifting: rising content costs, price sensitivity, global regulation. I don\u2019t see a durable business that will still be winning in 20 years without constant reinvention.\n\n7. Opportunity Cost: I\u2019d rather own a wonderful consumer staples business at a fair price\u2014see\u2019s Candies, Coca-Cola, Apple\u2014than a fair streaming business at any price.\n\nIn short, while Netflix is a fine enterprise for some, it sits outside my circle, lacks a clear moat, carries financial risk, and doesn\u2019t offer the margin of safety I demand. I\u2019ll pass for now.",
