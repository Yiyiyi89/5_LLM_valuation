  "reasoning": "First off, Amazon sits largely outside my circle of competence. I know retailing and simple distribution networks, but Amazon\u2019s mix of e-commerce, cloud-computing and constant reinvestment in new technologies is more complex than the straightforward businesses I\u2019ve stuck with for decades. That\u2019s a critical \u2018\u2018no\u2019\u2019 for me. Second, while Amazon enjoys some network effects and AWS has built a formidable market position, its competitive moat seems less durable than, say, Coca-Cola\u2019s brand or See\u2019s Candies\u2019 pricing power. E-commerce and cloud face relentless price competition, and inconsistent ROE\u2014only a 4.4% return last period\u2014and high reinvestment requirements undercut any wide, persistent moat. Third, management under Bezos and his successor has been visionary, but the company plows nearly all owner earnings back into growth initiatives rather than returning cash to shareholders. That\u2019s a far cry from the capital-allocators I admire, like the Munger-Buffett team at Berkshire or the Buffett-backed managers at GEICO. Fourth, the balance sheet and earnings consistency leave much to be desired: a debt-to-equity north of 1.3, choppy earnings growth and only modest return on invested capital. You don\u2019t build a \u2018\u2018financial fortress\u2019\u2019 that way. Fifth, the DCF intrinsic value, even on a conservative basis, comes in around $1,047 per share\u2014some 65% below today\u2019s market price. That leaves no margin of safety and a high risk of permanent capital loss. Sixth, while AWS could remain a cash cow, the retail side is capital-intensive, margins can compress, and tech platforms shift on a dime\u2014too many red flags for my forever-holding mindset. Finally, when I compare this to the likes of Coca-Cola at a fair price, Apple as a consumer ecosystem play, or BNSF with its simple, toll-road economics, Amazon simply doesn\u2019t make the cut for a Buffett-style portfolio. In plain English: I\u2019ll pass.",
