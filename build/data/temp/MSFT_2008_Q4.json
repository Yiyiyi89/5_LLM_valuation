  "reasoning": "First off, Microsoft lies outside my narrow circle of competence. I\u2019ve built my career around simple consumer businesses, banking, insurance and railroads \u2013 not complex enterprise software and cloud infrastructure. While you can argue Microsoft boasts a durable enterprise moat \u2013 high switching costs in Office 365 and Azure\u2019s scale advantages \u2013 it still remains a technology franchise that evolves faster than I can grasp, and I prefer what I know.\n\nOn the moat question, I\u2019ll give Microsoft credit for exceptionally strong operating margins (85.7%), 85% performance stability and network effects that lock in large corporate customers. But the inconsistent ROE record (only 11.8% last year and no periods over 15% in the last decade) tells me their competitive edge may not be as unassailable as it appears. In my view, a true fortress business generates double-digit returns on equity year in and year out.\n\nWhen it comes to management, Satya Nadella deserves praise for steering the company into cloud services. But the recent debt\u2010to\u2010equity of 1.0, recurring stock issuance and minimal dividends raise a caution flag on capital allocation. I prefer managers who pay meaningful dividends and avoid diluting existing shareholders.\n\nFinancially, Microsoft\u2019s earnings have been uneven and their return on invested capital sits at a modest 5.9%. A history of choppy growth \u2013 just 44.3% earnings growth over ten years \u2013 is nothing to write home about when compared to the steady compounding we see at Coca-Cola or See\u2019s Candies.\n\nValuation is the final nail in the coffin. Your three\u2010stage DCF pegs intrinsic value at roughly $41,200 per share after a 15% haircut, leaving a negative margin of safety of 83.5%. I\u2019d rather wait for a margin of safety than chase a fine business at a lofty price.\n\nLooking around my portfolio, I\u2019d much rather buy more Coke or Apple (where I understand the customer side and ecosystem) at a fair price than Microsoft at today\u2019s valuations. In the immortal words I\u2019ve often used, \u2018It\u2019s far better to buy a wonderful business at a fair price than a fair business at a wonderful price.\u2019 Microsoft today is a fair business at too wonderful a price \u2013 so I say no.",
