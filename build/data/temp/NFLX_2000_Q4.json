  "reasoning": "First off, Netflix sits well outside my Circle of Competence. I built my career focusing on straightforward businesses\u2014coke bottles, insurance premiums, railroad cars\u2014not the complexity of global streaming, heavy content spending and ever-shifting technology platforms. \n\nMoat: Netflix has scale and a household name, but its pricing power is under siege. Competitors like Disney+, Amazon and Apple TV+ keep chipping away. There\u2019s churn and a constant need to outspend foes on original content. That\u2019s hardly a durable, fortress-like advantage. \n\nManagement: I admire Reed Hastings\u2019 vision, but I\u2019m wary of a management team that plows massive capital into content with uncertain returns. I want owners who earn more than goodwill when they spend a dollar. Here, the track record of converting content dollars into free cash flow doesn\u2019t inspire the same confidence I have in see\u2019s candies or GEICO. \n\nFinancial Health: With no balance sheet or cash-flow details at hand, it\u2019s tough to judge Netflix\u2019s financial fortress. Anecdotally, I know they carry significant debt to finance content, and cash flow has been lumpy. That\u2019s a red flag for me\u2014I like predictability and minimal leverage. \n\nValuation: We have zero intrinsic value estimate here. Without a margin of safety, paying up in a business you don\u2019t fully grasp is a recipe for permanent capital loss. \n\nLong Term Prospects: Twelve years from now, I expect content distribution to look very different. Will Netflix still be on top? It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess. Contrast that with a business like Coca-Cola, which has quietly increased prices at five-percent-a-year for decades without losing a customer. \n\nComparison: I\u2019d rather own a wonderful, simple business I understand with a durable moat and great managers at a fair price than take a flyer here. In short, this one\u2019s a pass for me. I\u2019m not bearish on Netflix investors who understand streaming economics and can value content libraries, but I\u2019m neutral to the idea of betting my capital here.\n\n\u2013 Warren Buffett",
