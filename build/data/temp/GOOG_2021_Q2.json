  "reasoning": "Well, the first question is whether Google falls in my circle of competence. Frankly, it doesn\u2019t. I\u2019m a simple man who understands consumer products, insurance, banks, railroads and the like\u2014not complex algorithms, ad auctions and data science. My mantra is: \u201cRisk comes from not knowing what you\u2019re doing,\u201d and I simply don\u2019t know the ins and outs of search-engine economics and ad tech at a level I\u2019m comfortable with.\n\nThat said, Google clearly enjoys a formidable moat. Its search franchise is the default gateway to the internet for billions, and its scale in advertising creates a self-reinforcing network effect. But moat alone isn\u2019t enough if I can\u2019t get comfortable with the true drivers of value and potential threats\u2014like shifting consumer behavior, privacy regulations and antitrust scrutiny.\n\nI haven\u2019t met Sundar Pichai in person, but on paper Alphabet\u2019s management has delivered consistently strong returns and plowed cash into new bets (Waymo, Cloud) while maintaining a pristine balance sheet. Historically they\u2019ve shown discipline in picking winners, but with insufficient data here, I can\u2019t draw a firm conclusion.\n\nFinancially, Alphabet has generated fortress-like free cash flow and carries little debt. Yet without hard numbers in front of me, I can\u2019t assess consistency of earnings or the true quality of earnings\u2014another strike against diving in.\n\nValuation is a complete unknown in this exercise; we\u2019ve got no reliable intrinsic-value estimate or margin of safety. And I\u2019ve learned the hard way that paying up for growth without a clear understanding invites permanent capital loss.\n\nLooking out 20 years, Google may very well still dominate, but I worry about regulatory headwinds, rapid shifts in technology and competition from nimble upstarts. For me, it\u2019s simply not in the sweet spot where I have confidence.\n\nBy comparison, I\u2019d rather own a business like Coca-Cola or Apple\u2014a consumer franchise I understand, run by management I know, trading at a sensible multiple. When I can\u2019t get comfortable with a business or place a margin of safety under my estimate of intrinsic value, the answer is usually \u201cno.\u201d\n\nSo in this case, I\u2019ll pass\u2014not because I dislike Alphabet\u2019s prospects, but because it\u2019s outside my circle of competence and I can\u2019t form a precise judgment on valuation or fundamentals. I\u2019d call it neutral with low conviction.",
