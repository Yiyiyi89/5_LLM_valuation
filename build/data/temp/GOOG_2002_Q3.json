  "reasoning": "I\u2019ll be candid\u2014I don\u2019t have enough in the data to make a proper calculation of intrinsic value or margin of safety. And Google sits largely outside my circle of competence. I know it\u2019s a fantastic technology-driven advertising and search business, but I generally steer clear of complex algorithm-based models and rapidly evolving tech. That said:\n\n1. Circle of Competence: I fully understand consumer staples, insurance, banks, and simple industrials. Google, with its AI, cloud, and ad auction algorithms, is not a business I claim to deeply understand. In my words, \u201cRisk comes from not knowing what you\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\n2. Moat: On the surface, Google has a wide economic moat\u2014search dominance, network effects, and vast data advantages. But without detailed margin, revenue mix, and competitive trend data, I can\u2019t gauge how durable that moat will be over the next two decades against regulatory risk and fast-moving rivals.\n\n3. Management: Alphabet\u2019s team has delivered stellar growth, but I\u2019d need to be convinced that their capital allocation in moonshots (Waymo, Verily) won\u2019t detract from core returns. In businesses I\u2019ve loved\u2014See\u2019s Candies, Coca-Cola\u2014capital allocation was simple and conservative.\n\n4. Financial Health: From public reports I know Google\u2019s balance sheet is fortress-like: low debt, massive cash flow. But the prompt gives me no numbers, so I can\u2019t check consistency of earnings or return on invested capital trends.\n\n5. Valuation: Without intrinsic-value figures, multiples, or growth forecasts, there\u2019s no way to tell if the stock trades at a reasonable margin of safety. And I\u2019m going to pay a sensible price for a wonderful business, not chase growth at any cost.\n\n6. Long-Term Prospects & Red Flags: Google could thrive for decades, but regulatory antitrust pressure and AI competition could erode returns. I like businesses whose durability I can model in reasonable detail.\n\n7. Portfolio Comparison: At Berkshire, I\u2019d rather own a handful of great consumer-brand companies at fair prices than dabble in something I can\u2019t fully measure. My favorite holding period is forever, but only if I understand every driver of the business.\n\nWith insufficient data and outside my circle of competence, I\u2019m forced to say no decision\u2014neutral. Better to wait for clarity than risk permanent loss of capital.",
