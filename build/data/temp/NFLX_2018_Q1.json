  "reasoning": "First things first, streaming video isn\u2019t in my Circle of Competence. I\u2019ve spent my life understanding simple businesses like See\u2019s Candies, Coca-Cola and GEICO \u2013 not complex, capital-hungry content platforms. \n\nMoat: Netflix has built a strong brand and a deep library, but durable pricing power in media is questionable. Competitors like Disney+ and Amazon Prime have shown they\u2019ll undercut pricing to win subscribers, and content exclusivity can evaporate. While operating margins look healthy, that alone doesn\u2019t guarantee a lasting moat. \n\nManagement: Reed Hastings and his team have been savvy in content creation and subscriber growth, but I worry about the heavy debt load (D/E of 4.0) and large free-cash-flow deficits. Netflix isn\u2019t paying a dividend or buying back stock \u2013 they\u2019re leaning on debt to keep the content machine running. \n\nFinancial Health & Consistency: A ROE of 7.2% and ROIC around 1.4% are unimpressive. Earnings growth has been erratic, and the debt-to-equity ratio rings alarm bells for a consumer-facing business. You want consistency, and Netflix\u2019s earnings have swung wildly over the last ten periods. \n\nValuation: The three-stage DCF pegs intrinsic value at about $4,252 per share (after a 15% haircut), but the market price offers no margin of safety (MOS \u2248 \u201396%). I\u2019d rather own a wonderful business at a fair price than a fair business at a wonderful price, and here the price is well above value. \n\nLong-Term Prospects & Red Flags: Streaming will stay competitive, and content costs keep rising. With razor-thin returns on invested capital, Netflix faces an uphill battle to reward shareholders over decades. \n\nCompared to my existing holdings \u2013 businesses with enduring moats, predictable cash flows and conservative balance sheets \u2013 Netflix doesn\u2019t stack up. There\u2019s no penalty for sitting on cash when faced with a business outside your expertise and trading at a premium. \n\nSo, in my book: no, thanks \u2013 I\u2019ll pass and wait for something I truly understand at a sensible price.",
