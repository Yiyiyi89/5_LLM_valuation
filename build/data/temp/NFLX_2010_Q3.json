  "reasoning": "First things first, Netflix sits outside my circle of competence.  I don\u2019t pretend to be an expert in the intricacies of content creation, subscriber churn and streaming algorithms the way I understand consumer staples like Coca-Cola or banks like Bank of America.  Second, its competitive moat feels questionable.  Yes, strong operating margins (avg ~38%) show pricing power today, but a streaming business faces an endless arms race of content spending and ruthless competitors with low switching costs.  Third, management has financed growth by issuing stock and piling on debt (Debt/Equity ~3.0) rather than returning cash to shareholders \u2013 not the sort of capital allocation that excites me.  Fourth, while ROE of ~20% is respectable, earnings have been inconsistent (only 4 of 10 periods above 15% ROE) and the balance sheet is levered, with liquidity metrics unclear.  Fifth, the stock trades well above even a conservative intrinsic value estimate of ~$371 per share (15% haircut on a ~$436 DCF value), leaving a negative margin of safety.  Finally, long-term prospects in a cut-throat, capital-intensive industry full of rapid change and fading content exclusivity strike me as riskier than the durable, wide-moat businesses I prefer.  Compared to opportunities in my portfolio \u2013 think See\u2019s Candies, Apple and BNSF \u2013 Netflix simply fails the first rule: I don\u2019t understand it well enough, and it\u2019s not available at a very attractive price.  I\u2019ll pass.",
