  "reasoning": "1. Circle of Competence: I\u2019ve spent 60 years focusing on simple, predictable businesses \u2013 consumer staples, insurance, banks and railways. Alphabet (GOOG) is built on search algorithms, advertising auctions and cutting-edge AI. That\u2019s outside my wheelhouse, so I\u2019d be stepping on the gas in unfamiliar territory. 2. Moat: Google\u2019s scale and network effects in search and ads are impressive, but technology moats can vanish overnight. 3. Management: Sundar Pichai and team have a strong track record, yet I lack the detailed insight to judge capital allocation. 4. Financial Health: Presumably robust cash flows and low debt, but no data here. 5. Valuation: No reliable intrinsic-value estimate or margin of safety. 6. Long-Term Prospects: AI and cloud growth could be huge, yet the field is rapidly evolving and competitive. 7. Relative Comparison: Given the uncertainty, I\u2019d rather redeploy capital into businesses I thoroughly understand \u2013 like Coca-Cola or Apple within my circle \u2013 than venture too far afield without a clear margin of safety.",
