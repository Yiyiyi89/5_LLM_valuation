  "reasoning": "1. Circle of Competence: I\u2019m not comfortable claiming Google (GOOG) lies squarely within my circle of competence. Search advertising and complex algorithms are a far cry from soft drinks, insurance or railroads. As I\u2019ve said, \u201cRisk comes from not knowing what you\u2019re doing,\u201d and I simply don\u2019t understand the nuances of real\u2010time bidding, data privacy trade-offs and shifting regulatory winds in digital advertising well enough to count on them over decades.\n\n2. Competitive Moat: That said, Google does have characteristics of a moat\u2014dominant market share in search, a massive data advantage and network effects in advertising. These give it pricing power and barriers to entry. But tech moats aren\u2019t always durable. A breakthrough from a smaller, nimbler rival or a major antitrust action could erode its lead.\n\n3. Management Quality: The Alphabet management team is undoubtedly smart and has a track record of reinvesting cash flow into high-return projects (search monetization, YouTube, cloud). They think long term, but I\u2019m not confident they always act like owners in the way we see at Berkshire. They\u2019ve piled into moonshots that may never pay off.\n\n4. Financial Health: In public filings you\u2019d see a fortress balance sheet\u2014very low debt, rising free cash flow and high returns on capital. But our data here is insufficient to confirm consistency. Historically, Alphabet has been unwaveringly profitable, but past performance alone doesn\u2019t guarantee future stability in tech.\n\n5. Valuation vs. Intrinsic Value: We have no reliable intrinsic\u2010value estimate. Without it, there\u2019s no margin of safety to defend against downside risk. We like to pay well below what a business is worth; here we\u2019re flying blind.\n\n6. Long-Term Prospects & Red Flags: Over twenty years, Google could prosper if it stays atop search and wins in cloud, but faces regulatory scrutiny, privacy crackdowns and rapid innovation cycles. Those are powerful headwinds for a business model that relies on tracking and targeting.\n\n7. Comparison to Portfolio Opportunities: I\u2019d rather deploy capital in businesses I grasp\u2014Coca-Cola\u2019s simple formula, BNSF\u2019s steady rail earnings or a property-casualty insurer with actuarial predictability. If pushed, I\u2019d rather sit on cash than pay up for complexity I can\u2019t thoroughly assess.\n\nConclusion: This is not a fit for my style. With insufficient data, an opaque valuation, and an industry outside my sweet spot, I\u2019ll pass. I\u2019m comfortable being neutral here and waiting for something I truly understand.",
