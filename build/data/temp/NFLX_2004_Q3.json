  "reasoning": "1. Circle of Competence: I\u2019ve spent my life studying simple businesses with predictable economics, like See\u2019s Candies or Coca-Cola. Streaming video is a fast-changing, capital-intensive tech business full of content swings and fierce competition. I don\u2019t fully understand the mechanics of licensing, content creation costs and subscriber churn in this space, so it\u2019s outside my circle of competence.\n\n2. Competitive Moat: NFLX shows strong operating margins, but inconsistent ROE (only 0 out of 10 periods above 15%) and no durable barrier to entry. Competitors like Disney+, Amazon and new entrants can undercut pricing or bundle services. I don\u2019t see a wide economic moat here.\n\n3. Management & Capital Allocation: Management hasn\u2019t returned cash to shareholders via dividends or buybacks, and debt to equity sits at 0.6. With negative owner earnings of -$33 per share and reliance on external funding for content, I\u2019d rather see management acting like owners, as at GEICO or Bank of America.\n\n4. Financial Health & Consistency: ROE of 13.1% is modest given the risk, and earnings growth is erratic\u20140 points for consistency. Netflix\u2019s debt load and lack of free cash flow raise red flags for me, especially compared to Berkshire\u2019s strong, low-debt insurance and utility businesses.\n\n5. Valuation vs. Intrinsic Value: The three-stage DCF spits out a negative intrinsic value (\u2013$507 per share) and a negative margin of safety. I won\u2019t pay for a business that appears to destroy value on a present-value basis.\n\n6. Long-Term Prospects & Red Flags: I favor businesses that can compound value for decades. Netflix faces rising content costs, subscriber saturation in mature markets, and streaming wars. That\u2019s not the durable franchise I look for.\n\n7. Comparison to Our Portfolio: I\u2019d rather own a wonderful consumer staple or insurance company at a fair price than this business at any price. We\u2019re better off waiting for an opportunity in our circle, like Coca-Cola, Apple or Berkshire\u2019s insurance float.\n\nConclusion: I\u2019ll pass on NFLX. As I always say, \u201cIt\u2019s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.\u201d",
