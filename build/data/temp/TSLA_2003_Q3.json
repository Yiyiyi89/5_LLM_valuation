  "reasoning": "Well, I\u2019ve been asked to look under the hood at Tesla, and the first thing I\u2019ve got to say is that it sits far outside my Circle of Competence. I\u2019m a simple man who likes to invest in businesses I thoroughly understand\u2014Coca-Cola, See\u2019s Candies, insurance float\u2014and I confess I don\u2019t grasp the long-term economics of batteries, autonomous software or EV charging networks well enough to feel comfortable. \n\nAs for moats, Tesla\u2019s brand certainly has sizzle, but the auto industry is a tough, capital-hungry business, and competitors from traditional automakers to up-and-coming startups are all circling like sharks. Durable pricing power? I\u2019m not convinced. Today\u2019s edge often turns tomorrow\u2019s commodity. \n\nElon Musk is undeniably a visionary, but I\u2019ve learned that my ideal manager acts like an owner, is candid with shareholders, and avoids unnecessary complexity. I admire his passion, yet his style and constant tinkering create more volatility than the kind of steady stewardship I favor. \n\nTesla\u2019s profits are real\u2014but inconsistent\u2014and the balance sheet masks massive ongoing capital needs. I\u2019ve never met a business that can sustain sky-high valuations without a very predictable, fortress-like cash flow. \n\nFinally, at today\u2019s price, I see no margin of safety. I\u2019d rather own a wonderful business at a fair price than a fair business at a wonderful price. When in doubt, I simply say \u201cno.\u201d For me, that means passing on Tesla today. It may thrive or it may not\u2014but it\u2019s not a place for my dollars.",
