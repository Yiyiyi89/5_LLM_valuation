  "reasoning": "First things first: streaming video isn\u2019t in my circle of competence. I\u2019ve spent my life investing in simple businesses\u2014Coca-Cola, See\u2019s Candies, GEICO\u2014where I can peek under the hood and know exactly how the engine runs. Netflix is more akin to a never-ending movie budget mixed with tech algorithms, and that\u2019s a show I don\u2019t understand as well as my own backyard.\n\nWhen it comes to a moat, I see a brand that\u2019s well known, but one that\u2019s up against deep pockets from Disney, Amazon, Apple and the rest. Inconsistent ROE (only 1 of 10 years above 15%) and volatile earnings growth (\u201342.9% over 10 periods!) tell me any advantage is fragile at best.\n\nReed Hastings may be a smart fellow, but there\u2019s no sign of disciplined capital allocation. Heavy debt (debt-to-equity near 4), minimal dividends, and a reinvestment cycle that bleeds cash give me little comfort. I want managers who think like owners, preserve capital and know when to hold or fold\u2014this feels more like a content arms race.\n\nFinancially, a ROE of 1.2%, a putty-in-your-hands current ratio, and crazy swings in earnings leave me uneasy. Owner earnings of $28 per share are real, but piling that against a mountain of debt is not my idea of a fortress balance sheet.\n\nValuation is the final deal-breaker. Your DCF pegs intrinsic value at $314 (even after a 15% haircut), yet the market is bidding nearly twice that. A margin of safety close to \u2013100% means paying almost two dollars for every dollar of value. In my book, that\u2019s buying a wonderful business at a horrible price.\n\nIn my corner of the world, I\u2019d much rather own a cigarette-lighter business like See\u2019s Candies\u2014simple, durable pricing power, strong returns, and a valuation that makes sense. So my answer here is a clear no. Netflix is outside what I know, lacks a durable moat, carries too much risk on the balance sheet, and is overpriced by any reasonable standard. I\u2019ll keep my powder dry for moats I understand, at prices that make sense.",
