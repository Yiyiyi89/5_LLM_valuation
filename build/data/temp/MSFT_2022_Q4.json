  "reasoning": "First off, Microsoft falls outside my circle of competence. I understand consumer products, insurance and simple infrastructure \u2013 I don\u2019t pretend to have a crystal-clear grasp on the ins and outs of enterprise software, cloud economics and complex licensing models. As I\u2019ve said, \u201cRisk comes from not knowing what you\u2019re doing,\u201d and when it comes to Microsoft the data here only underlines my discomfort.\n\nOn the moat front, Microsoft certainly has some advantages \u2013 strong brand recognition, network effects in Windows and Azure, and operating margins north of 75%. But the inconsistent ROE (just one of ten periods above 15%) and a moat score of 1 out of 5 suggest that those advantages aren\u2019t translating into the durable, widening economic moat I look for in a business I\u2019ll own forever.\n\nManagement has shown talent under Satya Nadella\u2019s leadership, but the recent common\u2010stock issuance and the lack of an attractive dividend policy are warning flags. I want managers who behave like owners and distribute cash to shareholders where appropriate. Here, shareholder dilution appears to outpace returns.\n\nFinancially, Microsoft\u2019s story is a mixed bag. Strong operating margins are offset by a weak ROE of about 10%, a high debt-to-equity ratio of 1.2, and a spotty earnings growth pattern. Consistency is the lifeblood of a Buffett business, and the zero consistency score here rings an alarm bell.\n\nValuation-wise, the three-stage DCF pegs intrinsic value at roughly $40,066 per share after a conservative haircut. With the margin of safety at \u201398%, you\u2019d be paying dramatically more than the business is worth. As I always say, \u201cIt\u2019s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.\u201d At today\u2019s level, Microsoft is not a fair price.\n\nIn the long run, cloud leaders may prosper, but technology shifts can be swift and ruthless \u2013 not the steady, predictable waters I seek. Compared to what\u2019s in my portfolio today \u2013 Coca-Cola, Apple (my consumer ecosystem exception), BNSF, GEICO \u2013 Microsoft simply doesn\u2019t fit the mold. There\u2019s no penalty for patience, and in this case the answer is a clear \u201cno.\u201d",
