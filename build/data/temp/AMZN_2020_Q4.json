  "reasoning": "First, I have to decide if Amazon fits inside my circle of competence. Frankly, e-commerce and cloud computing are outside the simple, predictable businesses I understand best. I\u2019ve built my track record on soft drinks, insurance, railroads and simple consumer franchises \u2013 I know how much Coke costs to make, but I don\u2019t really know the long-term economics of AWS or the levers behind Amazon\u2019s razor-thin retail margins.\n\nWhen it comes to moat, Amazon certainly has scale advantages and network effects, but the data show inconsistent returns on equity (only 7.7% vs. my 15% hurdle), uneven earnings growth and a hefty debt-to-equity ratio of 2.4. A durable moat gives you pricing power and consistent returns; here, the moat looks leaky at times.\n\nOn management and capital allocation, Jeff Bezos has built an empire \u2014 I admire the vision \u2014 yet owner earnings are negative, and the company hasn\u2019t shown the kind of conservative balance sheet or clear capital-allocation philosophy I look for. No dividends, and reinvestment has yet to demonstrate reliable free cash flow to shareholders.\n\nFinancially, the picture is mixed. Operating margins are strong around 43%, but return on invested capital is a meager 2.2%, and earnings growth is erratic. My favorite gauge\u2014owner earnings\u2014is firmly negative. You don\u2019t want to pay a high price for a business burning cash.\n\nValuation is the final nail. A three-stage DCF spits out a negative intrinsic value and a margin of safety well below zero. You know my motto: \u201cPrice is what you pay, value is what you get.\u201d Here, the price vastly exceeds value.\n\nLong-term prospects? Amazon will be a massive company for decades, but I\u2019m cautious about investing in something I can\u2019t fully value. No red flag on legality or fraud\u2014just complexity and overvaluation.\n\nCompare this to what sits in my portfolio \u2013 Coca-Cola, See\u2019s Candies, Apple and GEICO \u2013 all businesses I grasp completely, generating reliable cash and trading at prices that offer real margin of safety. Amazon simply doesn\u2019t measure up to those opportunities in my playbook.\n\nIn short, this is a quality operation in its own right, but it\u2019s outside my wheelhouse, overly complex and priced for perfection. My answer: bearish.",
