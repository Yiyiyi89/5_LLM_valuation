  "reasoning": "First things first, Tesla falls well outside my circle of competence. I like consumer staples, banks, insurance and simple industrials \u2013 not a fast-moving, technology-heavy electric car maker that cranks out software updates and buzzworthy delivery numbers every quarter. My rule is simple: if I don\u2019t understand the business, I don\u2019t invest. \n\nSecond, Tesla\u2019s moat looks more like a garden gate than a fortress. Sure, they have a strong brand and a charger network, but the numbers tell a different story \u2013 inconsistent ROE (only 0 of 10 periods above 15%) and an uneven earnings history (\u20133.8% growth over 10 periods). That doesn\u2019t strike me as a durable competitive advantage.\n\nManagement under Elon Musk may get headlines, but capital allocation raises questions. No dividends, periodic equity issuances and negative owner earnings (\u2013$3,048 per share) suggest they\u2019re burning cash rather than generating it for shareholders. That\u2019s far from the disciplined, owner-oriented management I admire at See\u2019s Candies or Berkshire\u2019s insurance operations.\n\nOn financial health, the fundamentals are shaky: a thin ROE of 3.1%, debt/equity near 0.7, and a string of inconsistent earnings. A business needs both strong returns and consistency to earn a spot in my portfolio.\n\nValuation is the nail in the coffin. A three-stage DCF yields a negative intrinsic value (\u2013$34,790 per share after a haircut) and a negative margin of safety. You can\u2019t pay less than zero for something you hope will someday earn you money. That flies in the face of my principle: \u201cPrice is what you pay, value is what you get.\u201d\n\nLong term, electric vehicles may be a real story, but I see formidable competition, technological disruption, and an inability to forecast sustainable free cash flow. Those red flags outweigh any growth hopes.\n\nCompared to the likes of Coca-Cola, Apple or our insurance float businesses \u2013 where we understand the economics, have pricing power and see consistent owner-earnings \u2013 Tesla simply doesn\u2019t measure up. Therefore, I\u2019d sit this one out.",
