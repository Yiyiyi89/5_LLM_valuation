  "reasoning": "First and foremost, semiconductors are outside my circle of competence. I\u2019m not comfortable forecasting the next node sizes or GPU cycles any more than I am predicting election results. While NVIDIA shows strong operating margins \u2013 like a high-grade candy with occasional sweet spots \u2013 its return on equity (5.2 percent) and return on invested capital (4.0 percent) are underwhelming compared to what I look for in a business I understand. \n\nAs for the moat, NVIDIA\u2019s margins hint at some pricing power among GPU buyers, but inconsistent ROE over the last ten periods undercuts the idea of a durable, widening moat. A 72 percent performance stability suggests competitive strength today, but in an industry where yesterday\u2019s leader can be tomorrow\u2019s also-ran, I\u2019m skeptical of that moat lasting for decades. \n\nOn management, I see recent share issuance and no dividends \u2013 a sign they\u2019re plowing cash back into the business, but with diluted shareholders and no visible margin of safety. I prefer managers who think like owners and return excess cash to shareholders through dividends or buybacks when the price makes sense. \n\nFinancially, inconsistent earnings growth and a subpar current ratio (missing data) make me uneasy. Owner earnings of $76 per share translate to an intrinsic value of about $873 in my three-stage DCF, yet the stock trades at a premium that wipes out any margin of safety. Paying more than intrinsic value reminds me of overpaying at my first bargain basement sale \u2013 you can\u2019t manufacture a margin of safety after the fact. \n\nFinally, for long-term prospects, I\u2019d rather own stable, predictable businesses like Coca-Cola or See\u2019s Candies that don\u2019t hinge on the next chip node or supply chain disruption. NVIDIA might be the darling of the moment, but I\u2019m in the business of buying wonderful companies at fair prices, not fair companies at wonderful prices. \n\nCompared with opportunities in my portfolio \u2013 where I know the stakes, the economics, and the capital allocation plan \u2013 NVIDIA doesn\u2019t offer the clarity or margin of safety I demand. So my verdict is no: I\u2019ll stick to businesses I understand and wait patiently for a better opportunity.",
