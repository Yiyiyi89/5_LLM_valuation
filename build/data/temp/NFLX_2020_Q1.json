  "reasoning": "First things first: Netflix falls outside my circle of competence. I know a lot about consumer brands like Coca-Cola and Apple\u2019s ecosystem, but running a global content-creation and streaming platform with mountains of leased content and ever-present competition from deep-pocketed studios is simply too complex for my taste. \n\nOn the moat front, Netflix has built a recognizable brand and can raise prices from time to time, which shows some pricing power. But durable advantages? Content is perishable and footloose \u2013 today\u2019s hit series can disappear tomorrow, and rivals from Disney to Amazon will keep bidding up rights. Those are not the sort of impenetrable economic moats that have stuck around for decades. \n\nManagement has done a masterful job growing subscribers, but capital allocation leans heavily toward producing new content instead of returning cash to owners. No dividends, no meaningful share buybacks, and a debt-to-equity north of 3:1 means they\u2019re financing growth with other people\u2019s money. That\u2019s not the recipe for a fortress balance sheet I admire. \n\nOn financial health and consistency, ROE of 8.4% and ROIC of 2% look weak for a business supposedly earning scale advantages. Earnings gyrate wildly and free cash flow can be spotty once content spend hits this high. You want steadiness and predictability; this model hasn\u2019t shown it. \n\nValuation? The three-stage DCF pegs a conservative intrinsic value at about $10,000 per share after a 15% haircut, while the market price sits nearly double. A margin of safety on Netflix is negative 93%, which is a glaring red flag: I\u2019ve no interest in overpaying for a speculative promise. \n\nLooking ahead, streaming wars will only intensify, content costs will stay elevated, and subscriber growth in saturated markets slows. I\u2019d rather own Coca-Cola or Apple \u2013 businesses I fully understand, with genuine moats, a history of shareholder-friendly capital allocation, and proudly simple economics. \n\nWhen you can\u2019t reckon a business\u2019s true value and it trades at a hefty premium, the answer is usually just \u201cno.\u201d That\u2019s where I land on NFLX.",
