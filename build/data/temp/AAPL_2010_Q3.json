  "reasoning": "First, Apple sits inside my circle of competence \u2013 I understand the consumer-product business and the ecosystem lock-in it enjoys. But a deep moat and comfort in my circle don\u2019t override price. The metrics show strong operating margins north of 40% and high performance stability \u2013 evidence of pricing power and a durable competitive moat akin to Coca-Cola\u2019s brand advantage. Yet the inconsistent ROE (just 7.5% last period, 0/10 periods above 15%) and erratic earnings growth give me pause on consistency. \n\nManagement generally thinks like owners, but recent share issuance and minimal dividends suggest they\u2019re leaning on dilution rather than returning cash \u2013 not the ideal capital-allocation recipe. On the balance sheet, debt/equity of 0.5 is manageable, but weak ROIC (~5%) and lack of a current ratio raise some financial health concerns. \n\nThe three-stage DCF pegs conservative intrinsic value at about $38,800 a share, yet the market trades substantially above that \u2013 implying a negative 81% margin of safety. As I\u2019ve said, \u201cIt\u2019s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.\u201d Today\u2019s price makes Apple look like a wonderful company at a woefully high price. \n\nLong term, Apple\u2019s brand and ecosystem could prosper forever, but overpaying is a recipe for subpar returns. Compared to opportunities in my portfolio\u2014like Coca-Cola\u2019s steady growth or Berkshire\u2019s insurance float deployable at better rates\u2014Apple here doesn\u2019t offer enough upside. I\u2019ll sit on my hands.",
