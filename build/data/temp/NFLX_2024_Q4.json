  "reasoning": "First, this one falls outside my circle of competence. I understand consumer staples, insurance, railroads and the like\u2014not the economics of high-stakes content creation and streaming wars. Second, Netflix\u2019s moat looks shallow. Yes, operating margins average 44%, but its ROE topped 15% in zero of the past ten periods. That\u2019s a far cry from the durable, decades-long pricing power we see at Coca-Cola or Apple\u2019s ecosystem. Third, management has been diluting shareholders with equity issuances and pays no dividend\u2014hardly the owner-mindset I seek at See\u2019s or GEICO. Fourth, the balance sheet carries a debt-to-equity ratio north of 1.2, ROIC sits around 3.5%, and earnings have been inconsistent. Fifth, valuation is ludicrous: the market cap of about $335 billion dwarfs my conservative intrinsic estimate of roughly $25.6 billion, leaving a negative 92% margin of safety. Sixth, long-term prospects face fierce competition from Disney+, Amazon and HBO Max, each backed by deeper pockets. Finally, compared to opportunities in my portfolio\u2014Walmart trading at reasonable multiples, Berkshire\u2019s utilities and railroads, or Coke\u2019s steady cash flows\u2014Netflix looks overpriced and risky. In short, price is what you pay, value is what you get, and I\u2019d rather sit this one out.",
