  "reasoning": "1. Circle of Competence: Netflix sits squarely in the world of streaming media, content licensing deals and rapid subscriber churn\u2014far outside my simple, branded consumer-products comfort zone. If I don\u2019t understand the game, I don\u2019t play. 2. Competitive Moat: I see no durable moat. Disney+, Amazon Prime Video and newcomers are poaching content and customers. Content costs are high and replicable. 3. Management & Capital Allocation: Recent stock issuances dilute existing owners, and there\u2019s no dividend or buyback discipline\u2014hardly the mark of owners thinking long term. 4. Financial Health & Consistency: Yes, operating margins look strong at 66%, but ROE is negative (-2.5%), ROIC is negative and historical consistency is lacking. 5. Valuation: With intrinsic value around $40 and a market price above that, there\u2019s no margin of safety (\u201377%). I\u2019d rather own a solid business at a fair price. 6. Long-Term Prospects: The content arms race demands heavy spending, the competitive landscape is ruthless and subscriber growth can stall. 7. Opportunity Cost: I\u2019d deploy capital into businesses like Coca-Cola or Apple where pricing power, brand and management quality are clear. In short, this is outside my circle; I\u2019m not interested\u2014bearish on NFLX.",
