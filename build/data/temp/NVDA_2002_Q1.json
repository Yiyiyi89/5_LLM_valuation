  "reasoning": "First off, semiconductors aren\u2019t in my circle of competence. I\u2019ve spent six decades learning consumer staples, insurance, banks and railroads\u2014where I can size up a business like reading a billboard from the highway. NVIDIA\u2019s technology is more like a moon rocket to me; I don\u2019t have the expertise to handicap where margins and market share will be in five or ten years.\n\nOn the moat front, NVIDIA shows strong operating margins (35\u2009%) and rising book value, but its ROE has bounced all over the map, and I see no durable, wide moat akin to Coca-Cola\u2019s brand or See\u2019s Candies\u2019 hand-dipped reputation. High performance stability hints at some competitive edge, but in a business that changes faster than the weather, I wouldn\u2019t bank on it lasting decades.\n\nManagement hasn\u2019t been egregious\u2014they\u2019ve avoided massive share issuance\u2014but they\u2019ve also paid out little in dividends and haven\u2019t given us a rock-solid capital allocation track record that Berkshire shareholders can point to with confidence.\n\nThe financials are mixed. Operating margins look nice, but debt-to-equity near 0.8 and uneven earnings growth make me uncomfortable. I like to see consistency quarter after quarter, year after year.\n\nValuation is the final straw. A conservative intrinsic value of about $1,196 versus a trading price far above that gives you a negative margin of safety of 76\u2009%. Price is what you pay; margin of safety is what you get. Here, you\u2019re overpaying for a business with uncertain long-term prospects.\n\nLong term, the semiconductor industry is a high wire act\u2014rapid change, fierce competitors, shifting industry cycles. That\u2019s no place for impatient money or someone who demands a moat that can last half a century.\n\nI\u2019d rather deploy capital into businesses I understand\u2014like Coca-Cola, Apple, Bank of America, and BNSF\u2014where I can sleep soundly at night. NVIDIA might make a nice story for someone else, but for me and Berkshire, it\u2019s a no-play. When in doubt, I say neither yes nor maybe\u2014I say no.  ",
