  "reasoning": "First off, Nvidia falls well outside my circle of competence. I don\u2019t pretend to fully grasp the ins and outs of cutting-edge semiconductors or the razor-thin technology cycles that come with them. I much prefer businesses I understand\u2014Coca-Cola, Apple\u2019s consumer ecosystem or a simple railroad like BNSF.\n\nOn the moat front, Nvidia shows some hints of pricing power\u2014operating margins near 45% and performance stability at 88% suggest a strong competitive position today. But inconsistent ROE (0 out of 10 periods above 15%) and choppy earnings growth cloud the picture. A wonderful business should deliver both margin and consistency.\n\nManagement has taken dilutive actions through stock issuances and pays little in dividends. I look for capital stewards who think like owners, not growth chasers who dilute shareholders. That isn\u2019t the quality I admire in a Buffett-type investment.\n\nFinancially, there are bright spots\u2014conservative debt levels and robust operating margins\u2014but the ROIC of 5.7% and uneven earnings history ring warning bells. A fortress balance sheet should also deliver steady, predictable returns over time.\n\nValuation is the deal breaker. Your DCF pegs conservative intrinsic value at $2,253 a share. With the stock trading well above that (a margin of safety of \u201384%), you\u2019re paying a hefty premium for promises of future growth. I\u2019d rather wait for an opportunity where price gives me the wind at my back.\n\nLong term, semis face shifting technology cycles, fierce competition from AMD, Intel and TSMC, and rapid obsolescence. That\u2019s a tough environment for a \u2018\u2018forever\u2019\u2019 holding period.\n\nCompared to the likes of Coca-Cola or Apple (where I see durable moats, loyal customers, terrific capital allocation and reasonable valuations), Nvidia simply doesn\u2019t measure up in my framework. I\u2019ll pass.",
