  "reasoning": "First, Microsoft isn\u2019t in my circle of competence. I own Apple as a consumer\u2010products play with a tight ecosystem; I don\u2019t pretend to understand every nook and cranny of software platforms and cloud infrastructure. Second, its moat shows up more in operating margins than in consistent returns on equity \u2013 only 1 of 10 years above 15% ROE and a decade of -14.9% earnings growth is hardly inspiring. Third, management issued stock lately and pays little in dividends, suggesting capital allocation that doesn\u2019t scream \u2018owner mentality.\u2019 Fourth, the balance sheet isn\u2019t a fortress: an 0.9 debt/equity ratio and weak ROIC (4.7%) leave me uneasy, and earnings are anything but consistent. Fifth, at today\u2019s market cap you\u2019re paying roughly 1.8 times my conservative intrinsic value and you lack a margin of safety. Finally, while tech has an exciting long horizon, it also has rapid change and fierce competition. Compared to the Coca-Colas or GEICOs I know, I\u2019ll pass.",
