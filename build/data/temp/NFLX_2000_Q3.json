  "reasoning": "First and foremost, Netflix sits well outside my circle of competence. I understand consumer staples, insurance, banks and simple industrials with durable moats, but streaming media\u2014with complex content rights, heavy technology spend and unproven long-term economics\u2014is unfamiliar territory. Because I don\u2019t fully grasp the business model or how its economics will hold up over decades, I can\u2019t confidently assess its moat. The streaming space looks fiercely competitive: Disney, Amazon, Apple and deep-pocketed incumbents will slug it out on content budgets. Without clear switching costs or pricing power\u2014customers can easily cancel and jump to another service\u2014I see no sustainable fortress around Netflix\u2019s revenues. Management has shown flair in building a subscriber base, but I lack data on capital allocation: Are they deploying cash wisely or simply chasing growth at any cost? With no reliable balance-sheet or cash-flow figures provided, I can\u2019t judge the financial fortress. Likewise, intrinsic value remains a blank page with no margin of safety to consider. Long term, I\u2019d worry about rising content costs, subscriber churn and the danger of overpaying for infinite new shows. Compared to opportunities I already own\u2014Coca-Cola\u2019s enduring brand, Apple\u2019s ecosystem, Bank of America\u2019s strong deposit base\u2014Netflix doesn\u2019t match up in clarity, moat or valuation. When in doubt, the answer is no. Therefore, I\u2019d pass on NFLX until I truly understand it and can see a durable competitive edge.",
