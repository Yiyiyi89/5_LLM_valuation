  "reasoning": "First things first: Netflix isn\u2019t in my circle of competence. I understand soft drinks, insurance, railroads and the consumer products business, but I don\u2019t pretend to understand the economics of content budgets, subscriber churn and global streaming rights. As I\u2019ve often said, \u201cRisk comes from not knowing what you\u2019re doing.\u201d This one\u2019s outside my wheelhouse.\n\nSecond, let\u2019s talk moat. A 44% operating margin might suggest scale, but inconsistent ROE (just 6.5% on average, with zero out of ten periods above 15%) and negative earnings growth of \u201312.8% over ten reporting periods tell me that pricing power and durable advantages aren\u2019t as strong as they look on the surface. Competitors from Disney to Amazon can match or undercut Netflix\u2019s content offerings, and subscriber loyalty can be bought or lost at the tap of a button.\n\nThird, management has certainly grown the business, but at what cost? A debt-to-equity ratio north of 1.2 and recurring common stock issuances point to dilution and a heavy reliance on borrowed money to fund content creation. Owner earnings are respectable at $1,438 million, but there are no dividends and little evidence of conservative capital allocation that I admire in Berkshire\u2019s insurance or utility operations.\n\nFourth, the financial fortress here is shaky. With inconsistent earnings growth, a weak ROIC of 2.9%, and no margin of safety (the DCF implies a 91% overvaluation), I\u2019d view this as a levered consumer technology play, not the kind of fortress balance sheet that calms an investor on a rainy day.\n\nFifth, on valuation, the three-stage DCF yields a conservative intrinsic value of about $14,400 (versus a current market cap implying far higher), leaving no room for error. As I like to say, \u201cPrice is what you pay, value is what you get,\u201d and here the gap works against shareholders.\n\nSixth, the long-term picture is cloudy: relentless competition, skyrocketing content budgets and a fickle consumer make predictability next to impossible. I\u2019d much rather own a business like Coca-Cola or See\u2019s Candies, where the economics are simple and the moat is clear.\n\nIn my portfolio, I\u2019m looking for simplicity, durability and a margin of safety. Netflix brings complexity, capital intensity, and valuation risk. When in doubt, I say thanks, but no thanks.",
