  "reasoning": "First off, Microsoft isn\u2019t in my circle of competence. I\u2019m comfortable buying simple consumer franchises like Coca-Cola or See\u2019s Candies, or steel-whistle-blowing railroads at BNSF. Microsoft is a sprawling software and cloud business with Azure, Windows, enterprise licensing and now AI. I don\u2019t fully grasp the industry dynamics, so I\u2019ll pass.\n\nAs for the moat, they do enjoy strong operating margins\u201475% is nothing to sneeze at\u2014and they have genuine switching costs. But their ROE has only topped 15% in zero out of ten periods, and ROIC sits at a tepid 4%. A wide economic moat requires consistent returns on capital, and that\u2019s missing here.\n\nManagement has been aggressive with stock issuances and hasn\u2019t paid much in dividends, diluting shareholders more than I\u2019d like. I don\u2019t see the kind of owner-oriented capital allocation that we prize at Berkshire.\n\nFinancially, a 1.6 debt-to-equity ratio and inconsistent earnings growth raise red flags. You want a fortress balance sheet, not one leaning on heavy leverage.\n\nValuation is the final nail in the coffin. Your DCF pegs intrinsic value at about $122,000 (after a 15% haircut) versus a market cap north of $1.1 million. That\u2019s an 89% negative margin of safety\u2014I\u2019d be paying $1.00 for seventy-nine cents worth of business.\n\nIn my book, I\u2019d much rather own a wonderful business at a fair price than Microsoft at a sky-high valuation. For those reasons, I\u2019d sit this one out.",
