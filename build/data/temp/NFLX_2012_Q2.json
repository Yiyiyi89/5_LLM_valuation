  "reasoning": "First off, Netflix isn\u2019t a business I really understand inside my circle of competence. I steer clear of complex technology platforms\u2014streaming content, churn models and giant content budgets aren\u2019t my wheelhouse. Second, its moat looks shallow. Yes, operating margins around 29% suggest scale, but switching costs are low, and competitors from Apple to Disney can undercut pricing or invest in content. Third, management has shown great ambition building content libraries, yet they\u2019ve leaned on debt (debt/equity north of 4) and owner earnings are virtually flat. I respect capital allocation, but piling on leverage to chase growth makes me uneasy. Fourth, the fundamentals and consistency are lacking\u2014ROE under 1%, inconsistent earnings growth (down over 80% in ten periods) and little free cash flow. Fifth, at an intrinsic value of roughly $49 and a negative margin of safety, you\u2019re paying a rich price for a business in decline. Sixth, long-term prospects face red flags: content spending arms races, saturation in developed markets and uncertain subscriber economics. Lastly, I\u2019d rather own wonderful businesses like Coca-Cola, Apple or BNSF at even fairer prices than bet on a fair business at a rich price. In short, I\u2019d sit this one out.",
