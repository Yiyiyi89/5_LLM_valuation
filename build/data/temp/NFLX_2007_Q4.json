  "reasoning": "First off, I have to admit that streaming video isn\u2019t in my circle of competence. I\u2019ve made my money understanding businesses like Coca-Cola, See\u2019s Candies and banks\u2014simple, predictable economics with durable moats. Netflix\u2019s model depends on ever-rising content costs, fickle consumer tastes and rapid technology change, and that\u2019s not a place I want my capital.\n\nOn the moat front, Netflix may boast high operating margins today (over 35%), but inconsistent ROE (only 1 of 10 periods above 15%) and no real switching costs spell a weak competitive barrier. Customers can cancel or jump to Disney+, Amazon or any new entrant with little friction.\n\nManagement has shown ambition by issuing stock (risking dilution) and plowing cash into content, but owner earnings are negative (\u2013$15.8 per share) and there have been no dividends. That tells me capital allocation is geared toward growth at all costs rather than disciplined returns, a red flag for a Buffett investor.\n\nFinancially, a 0.5 debt-to-equity ratio isn\u2019t crippling, but the inconsistent earnings growth (zero points in consistency analysis) and negative intrinsic value from the three-stage DCF (intrinsic value pegged at \u2013$162 per share) make it clear Netflix is not generating value for shareholders today. A negative margin of safety underscores that you\u2019re paying for a promise, not current results.\n\nValuation relative to intrinsic value is the final nail: you\u2019re getting no margin of safety, but rather paying up for uncertain future subscriber gains in an increasingly competitive market. I\u2019d much rather own a wonderful business at a fair price than a fair business at a wonderful price.\n\nLong term, Netflix faces high content costs, regulation and competitor onslaught. It\u2019s not the forever business I look for. In my portfolio I\u2019m happier with the likes of Apple\u2019s ecosystem, Coca-Cola\u2019s global brand or BNSF\u2019s rail moat, all of which offer predictable cash flows and real pricing power.\n\nSo for me, the answer is a firm \u2018no\u2019\u2014bearish on NFLX with high confidence. When I don\u2019t understand a business well enough or can\u2019t value it with a margin of safety, I walk away.",
