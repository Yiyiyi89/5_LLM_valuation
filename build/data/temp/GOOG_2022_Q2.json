  "reasoning": "This falls outside my circle of competence. I know consumer brands, banks, insurance and simple industrials, but the intricacies of algorithms, cloud infrastructure and AI at Google are beyond what I understand well enough to invest. While on the surface GOOG seems to enjoy a moat\u2014dominant market share in search, network effects in advertising and switching costs\u2014there\u2019s insufficient data here for me to assess its durability. Management under Sundar Pichai appears competent, yet I lack insight into their capital allocation choices across R&D and acquisitions. Without fundamentals, balance\u2010sheet strength or a clear valuation, I can\u2019t determine a margin of safety. The long-term prospects in AI and cloud could be bright, but I\u2019d rather own wonderful businesses I grasp\u2014like Coca-Cola or Apple\u2014at a price I can calculate. In this case, I politely pass, so my signal is neutral with low conviction until I see the numbers.",
