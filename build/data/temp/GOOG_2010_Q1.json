  "reasoning": "I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m not comfortable putting Alphabet (GOOG) into my portfolio at this time.  First off, the data provided here is next to nothing \u2013 we\u2019ve got zero insight into fundamentals, no history to judge consistency, and no valuation to speak of.  But even if the numbers were dropped in front of me, Google sits outside the simple, consumer\u2010oriented circle I understand best.  I\u2019ve steered clear of most high-tech companies because risk comes from not knowing what you\u2019re doing, and except for Apple\u2019s ecosystem I don\u2019t pretend to grasp the intricacies of online advertising auctions, data markets, or artificial intelligence algorithms. \n\nThat said, everyone talks about Google\u2019s moat \u2013 network effects in search, the breadth of its ad platform, and its data trove.  They\u2019ve certainly built something large and hard to replicate, but without concrete metrics I can\u2019t assess how durable it will be against regulatory risk or fierce competition. \n\nManagement at Alphabet is often praised for smart capital allocation, buying back shares and investing in research, but again I lack details here.  Their balance sheet is reported to be strong, but this stub of a report tells me nothing about margins, return on capital, or debt levels.  And with no intrinsic-value estimate or margin of safety calculation on the table, there\u2019s no way to know if the price is reasonable.  \n\nLong term, technology shifts are rapid, and while I admire any company that can stay ahead, it\u2019s not the sort of business I\u2019ve chosen to make my bed in.  Compared to the likes of Coca-Cola\u2019s predictability or See\u2019s Candies\u2019 enduring brand power, Alphabet feels too fluid, too much inside my blind spot.  \n\nIn short, with no real data and a business outside my circle of competence, I\u2019ll pass for now.  When in doubt, the answer is usually no \u2013 there\u2019s no penalty for missing an opportunity, only for losing money.",
