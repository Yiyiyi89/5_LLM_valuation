  "reasoning": "First off, streaming video is outside my circle of competence \u2013 I understand soft drinks, insurance, railroads and simple consumer merch, but not high-stakes content licensing and subscription wars. Second, Netflix\u2019s moat looks shaky: yes, they\u2019ve shown strong operating margins around 36%, but inconsistent ROE (just 0 of 10 years above 15%) and fierce competition from Amazon, Disney and others mean pricing power is far from assured. Third, management has driven subscriber growth, but the recent equity issuance dilutes owners and there\u2019s no dividend \u2013 capital allocation hasn\u2019t been particularly owner-friendly. Fourth, financially they carry a hefty debt-to-equity of 0.8, weak ROE of 10%, and uneven earnings growth; that\u2019s a financial fortress I wouldn\u2019t want to storm. Fifth, at a current price that implies an 84% negative margin of safety versus a conservative intrinsic value of $357, I\u2019d be overpaying for a fair business rather than buying a wonderful business at a fair price. Finally, in comparison to what I already own \u2013 Coca-Cola, Apple, BNSF and GEICO \u2013 there\u2019s nothing here that beats those high-quality, durable-moat franchises. I\u2019ll pass.",
