  "reasoning": "First off, I don\u2019t invest in semiconductors \u2013 they lie outside my circle of competence. Risk comes from not knowing what you\u2019re doing, and I\u2019ve never claimed to understand every twist and turn of a chip maker\u2019s world. While NVIDIA shows eye-popping operating margins (61%) and an 81% stability score, its return on equity is a mere 5.7%, earnings have been erratic, and management has been diluting shares without paying dividends. Its debt-to-equity of 0.6 and a negative margin of safety of 85% tell me the stock is priced far above any reasonable intrinsic value. Yes, the market may reward future growth, but I\u2019d rather own a durable business like Coca-Cola or See\u2019s Candies at a fair price than stretch for a complex technology story at today\u2019s valuation. For these reasons, I\u2019ll pass on NVIDIA.",
