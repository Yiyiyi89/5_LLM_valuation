  "reasoning": "First off, Microsoft sits squarely in the software business, which is outside my circle of competence. Warren Buffett once said, \u201cRisk comes from not knowing what you\u2019re doing,\u201d and I simply don\u2019t claim a deep understanding of complex technology platforms the way I do with consumer staples or simple industrials. \n\nAs for the moat, Microsoft does enjoy strong operating margins (77.8%) and network effects in Office and Windows, but the inconsistent ROE (only 0 out of 10 periods above 15%) suggests its competitive advantage may not be as durable as we\u2019d like. Cloud competition is fierce, and switching costs only carry you so far when rivals are throwing big subsidies at enterprise customers. \n\nManagement under Satya Nadella has done well driving cloud growth, yet the recent common\u2010stock issuance and minimal dividend policy raise a red flag for someone who prizes shareholder-friendly capital allocation. I prefer managers who think like owners, buy back shares when they\u2019re cheap, and hand out dividends when cash flows are generous. \n\nFinancially, a ROE of 12.9%, a debt/equity ratio of 1.8, and uneven earnings growth undermine the picture of a financial fortress. We like consistency, and here the earnings pattern is erratic despite an overall 140% gain over ten periods. \n\nOn valuation, the DCF pegs fair value\u2014after a 15% haircut\u2014around $91 billion of intrinsic value versus today\u2019s $963 billion market cap. In plain English, the market price is about ten times my conservative estimate of worth. As I often remind folks, \u2018Price is what you pay, value is what you get,\u2019 and here there\u2019s no margin of safety. \n\nLong-term, Microsoft may well benefit from AI and cloud tailwinds, but rapid change breeds winners and losers. Compared to opportunities in Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, and the Apple exception\u2014businesses I understand and can own \u2018forever\u2019 at sensible prices\u2014Microsoft simply doesn\u2019t meet my criteria. In the final analysis, this is a business I\u2019d rather admire from the sidelines than invest in.",
