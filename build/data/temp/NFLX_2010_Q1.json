  "reasoning": "1. Circle of Competence: I stick to businesses I truly understand \u2013 consumer goods, insurance, railroads \u2013 not streaming platforms that spend billions on films and shows. Netflix falls well outside my wheelhouse. 2. Moat: While Netflix has brand recognition and a loyal subscriber base, its competitive advantage is thin. Studios, new streaming entrants and deep-pocketed tech giants can replicate content and pricing nearly at will. 3. Management: Reed Hastings and team have shown creativity, but they\u2019ve also raised capital repeatedly, diluting shareholders. There's no meaningful dividend or buyback, just more debt to fund content. 4. Financial Health & Consistency: Yes, ROE of 22% and healthy margins look nice, but debt-to-equity north of 3.4 and erratic earnings growth undermine stability. The company\u2019s performance has swung wildly, and the balance sheet carries sizable risk. 5. Valuation: My DCF pegs intrinsic value around $460/share (even the conservative estimate). With Netflix trading well above that, there\u2019s a deeply negative margin of safety (-85.6%). I won\u2019t pay more for the business than it\u2019s worth. 6. Long-Term Prospects & Red Flags: Streaming is likely to consolidate and margins could compress as competition intensifies. Content costs keep rising, and subscriber growth is maturing. 7. Opportunity Cost: I\u2019d rather own wonderful businesses like Coca-Cola, See\u2019s Candies or Apple \u2013 where pricing power, capital allocation and financial fortitude are rock solid \u2013 at fair prices than gamble on an overvalued streaming service. In short, Netflix is outside my circle, overpaid for its uncertain future, and carries too much debt. The answer here is no.",
