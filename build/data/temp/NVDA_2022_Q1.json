  "reasoning": "First off, chips like Nvidia are outside my circle of competence. I\u2019ve spent my life studying simple businesses with durable moats\u2014bra nds you drink at breakfast (Coca-Cola), utility rails you ride on (BNSF), insurers you trust (GEICO)\u2014not the fast-changing world of semiconductors.  \n\nThe data show mixed signals for a moat. Operating margins of 69.6% look impressive, but ROE has never topped 15% in ten periods. That tells me pricing power may be real, yet inconsistent returns hint the moat could be narrower than it appears.  \n\nManagement has been raising equity, diluting shareholders, and isn\u2019t paying dividends. I like teams that think like owners; issuing stock isn\u2019t a deal breaker, but I want to see cash returned when the franchise is clearly fortressed.  \n\nOn the balance sheet, debt to equity near 0.7 is higher than I\u2019m comfortable with, especially in a cyclical, capital-intensive industry. ROIC is a tepid 3.6%, and earnings show up and down patterns rather than the steady growth I look for.  \n\nValuation is the last straw: a three-stage DCF pegs intrinsic value around $13,330 (after haircut), and yet the margin of safety is deeply negative. In plain terms, you\u2019re paying full price for tomorrow\u2019s uncertainty, not buying with a margin of safety.  \n\nLong term, I\u2019d worry about Moore\u2019s Law slowdowns, geopolitical risks, and the next hot architecture eating today\u2019s profits. I\u2019d rather own a durable business trading at a fair price than a high-flier with an ever-changing horizon.  \n\nCompared to holding Coca-Cola or Apple\u2014businesses I understand inside and out\u2014Nvidia is a leap into complexity with too many unknowns and too high a price. In the Buffett playbook, that\u2019s a clear \u201cno.\u201d  ",
