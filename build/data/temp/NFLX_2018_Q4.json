  "reasoning": "1. Circle of Competence: Streaming video and content creation isn\u2019t a business I deeply understand. I stick to consumer goods, insurance, banks and simple industrials \u2013 not a headlong dive into Hollywood budgets and technology platforms.\n2. Competitive Moat: While Netflix has scale and a recognizable brand, its content library can be replicated by deep-pocketed rivals. Pricing power erodes when subscribers churn for cheaper or free alternatives.\n3. Management Quality: Reed Hastings and team have shown creativity, but heavy spending on content and a debt\u2010laden capital structure suggest more owner-friendly capital allocation elsewhere.\n4. Financial Health & Consistency: ROE of just 2.6%, debt-to-equity near 4.0, spotty earnings growth \u2013 these aren\u2019t hallmarks of a fortress balance sheet or consistent earnings machine.\n5. Valuation vs. Intrinsic Value: Your DCF pegs conservative intrinsic value at $272, yet the stock trades far above that. Margin of safety is deeply negative \u2013 paying up here risks permanent loss.\n6. Long-Term Prospects & Red Flags: Intensifying competition, rising content costs and viewer churn threaten returns. This isn\u2019t the kind of predictable, growing cash cow I favor.\n7. Relative Opportunity: I\u2019d rather own Coke\u2019s fizzy moat, Apple\u2019s sticky ecosystem or Berkshire\u2019s insurance franchises. Netflix fails on circle of competence, consistency and valuation \u2013 I\u2019ll pass.",
