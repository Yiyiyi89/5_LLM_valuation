  "reasoning": "Well, the very first thing I look at is whether a business falls inside my circle of competence. Google\u2019s core operation\u2014complex search algorithms, online advertising auctions, and sprawling technology investments\u2014lies outside what I claim to understand in depth. That\u2019s critical. If you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing, risk comes from that very fact. \n\nAs for a moat, I recognize Google does have strong network effects in search and advertising, plus some switching costs with Android and YouTube. But without detailed data here, I can\u2019t measure the durability of those advantages\u2014or how challengers might nibble at that edge over the next 20 years. \n\nOn management, I respect Alphabet\u2019s leaders for long\u2010term thinking and capital allocation, but the information provided is insufficient to form a clear view. My standard is to see honest, owner\u2010like behavior in their financial decisions. With no meaningful governance or spend data, I\u2019m left guessing. \n\nFinancial health and consistency are unknown in this package. I like companies that churn out dependable earnings and keep debt low. The lack of balance\u2010sheet or cash\u2010flow detail here prevents any assessment. \n\nValuation? There\u2019s no intrinsic value estimate or margin of safety shown. Remember, price is what you pay, value is what you get\u2014and we need both sides of that equation. Without a solid estimate, I can\u2019t tell if the stock is attractively priced. \n\nLong term, Google\u2019s businesses may prosper for decades, but I\u2019m cautious when I can\u2019t size up potential regulatory hurdles or swings in ad spending. It\u2019s a different animal from the simple consumer brand names I prefer, like Coca-Cola or See\u2019s Candies. \n\nCompared with opportunities in my existing circle\u2014steady consumer staples, insurance franchises, railroads\u2014I\u2019d rather wait for something I can really sink my teeth into and understand thoroughly. In this case, that means passing for now.",
