  "reasoning": "1. Circle of Competence: I\u2019ve spent my career in businesses I understand \u2013 insurance, railroads, consumer products and simple banking. GPUs and cutting-edge semiconductors lie outside my comfort zone. I frankly don\u2019t grasp all the technical intricacies or competitive headwinds in that arena, so I\u2019m already on the sidelines. 2. Competitive Moat: Nvidia shows eye-popping operating margins, but its ROE has been under 15% every year in the last decade. High performance stability suggests some pricing power, but inconsistent returns on capital argue there\u2019s no wide, durable moat like Coke\u2019s brand or BNSF\u2019s network. 3. Management & Capital Allocation: Issuing new shares and paying no dividend isn\u2019t the kind of owner-focused behavior I admire. I want managers who treat each dollar as their own, not simply pump more stock into the market. 4. Financial Health & Consistency: A 4.9% ROE, debt-to-equity near 0.7 and erratic earnings growth leave me uneasy. I like companies that earn predictable returns year in and year out. 5. Valuation vs. Intrinsic Value: A three-stage DCF pegs intrinsic value at roughly $3,160 with a generous 15% haircut. At a market cap north of $16 trillion and a margin of safety of \u201380%, it\u2019s priced for perfection. That rarely ends well. 6. Long-Term Prospects & Red Flags: Technology shifts rapidly, and I\u2019ve seen once-dominant players stumble when the next innovation hit the market. Without proven resilience through multiple cycles, Nvidia feels more like a high-flying punt than a forever holding. 7. Comparison to My Portfolio: I\u2019d much rather own a consumer staple like Coca-Cola or a simple utility that can raise prices and grow steadily than place a big bet on a complex semiconductor that I don\u2019t thoroughly understand. In short, I\u2019d rather say \u201cno\u201d than risk permanent capital loss. This one\u2019s a pass for me.",
