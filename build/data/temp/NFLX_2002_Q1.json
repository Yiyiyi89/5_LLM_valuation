  "reasoning": "1. Circle of Competence: I\u2019ve spent 60 years staying in my knitting\u2014consumer staples, insurance, railroads and simple industrials. Netflix sits at the intersection of technology, content creation, and fickle consumer tastes. That\u2019s outside my circle. As I\u2019ve said, \u201cRisk comes from not knowing what you\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\n2. Competitive Moat: Netflix has brand recognition and a huge subscriber base, but its moat is narrow. Content libraries can be countered by deep-pocketed rivals\u2014Disney, Amazon, Apple\u2014all vying for your attention. It\u2019s like trying to hold back a river with a sandcastle.\n\n3. Management & Capital Allocation: Reed Hastings is a smart fellow, but plowing billions into original content is a high-stakes game. There\u2019s little evidence of returns comparable to what we\u2019ve seen at GEICO or See\u2019s Candies. I prefer managers who invest capital conservatively and earn predictable returns.\n\n4. Financial Health & Consistency: Streaming is notorious for heavy debt loads and negative free cash flow. Without data here, history tells us Netflix borrows heavily to fund content. That\u2019s the opposite of the fortress balance sheet I prize.\n\n5. Valuation vs. Intrinsic Value: With no intrinsic\u2010value estimate, we can\u2019t be sure we\u2019re paying a reasonable price. But markets have often valued Netflix as a hyper-growth story. I\u2019d demand a large margin of safety, which simply doesn\u2019t exist at current levels.\n\n6. Long\u2010Term Prospects & Red Flags: Technology and content trends shift rapidly. Subscriber growth can stall, churn can spike with pricing changes, and competition is fierce. Those are red flags for a long-term holding period \u201cforever.\u201d\n\n7. Comparison to My Portfolio: I\u2019d rather own Coca-Cola\u2019s enduring brands or Apple\u2019s ecosystem with its predictable free cash flow. Netflix\u2019s free cash flow is unpredictable, and the industry changes too fast for me.\n\nConclusion: I\u2019d pass. There\u2019s no penalty for saying \"no\"\u2014only for losing money chasing complex businesses I don\u2019t fully understand.",
