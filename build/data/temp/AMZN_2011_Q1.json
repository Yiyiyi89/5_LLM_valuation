  "reasoning": "First things first \u2013 Amazon isn\u2019t in my circle of competence. I\u2019ve spent my life understanding simple retail businesses like Walmart and Costco or consumer stalwarts like Coca-Cola, not a sprawling combination of online retail and a hyper-complex cloud computing operation. If I don\u2019t fully grasp how a business makes its money and keeps competitors at bay, I steer clear.\n\nOn a moat, Amazon has brand recognition and scale, but the numbers tell a mixed story. Their operating margins look healthy at about 24.9%, yet ROE sits at a flimsy 2.7% and earnings growth over the last ten periods is down 10.7%. That\u2019s not what I call a fortress. A real moat shows up as consistently high returns on equity and stable margins \u2013 think See\u2019s Candies or Coca-Cola.\n\nManagement under Jeff Bezos certainly knows how to grow sales, but they\u2019ve plowed almost every dollar back into the business rather than returning capital to owners. No dividends, no steady share buybacks until recently. That\u2019s great if you\u2019re aiming for skyrocketing revenue, but I want management that allocates capital wisely to maximize owner earnings \u2013 the hallmark of a Berkshire-style investment.\n\nOn financial health, Amazon\u2019s debt-to-equity ratio is north of 1.3, and with inconsistent earnings and a negative margin of safety, it feels more like a high-stakes growth play than a financial fortress. My preference is companies that generate predictable owner earnings year after year with little reliance on heavy borrowing.\n\nValuation is the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. A three-stage DCF pegs intrinsic value at about $1,189, yet shares trade well above that. Paying nearly double intrinsic value means you\u2019re betting the next decade will be flawless \u2013 I\u2019d rather buy a wonderful business at a fair price than a fair business at a wonderful price.\n\nLong term, e-commerce and cloud will keep growing, but competition from Microsoft, Google and a host of nimble online retailers could pressure margins. Regulation risk looms as governments scrutinize big tech. For me, the red flags outweigh the promise.\n\nCompared to opportunities I\u2019ve already stashed in the portfolio \u2013 think Coca-Cola\u2019s steady cash flows, Bank of America\u2019s attractive returns on equity, GEICO\u2019s underwriting discipline \u2013 Amazon just doesn\u2019t fit. When in doubt, I say no. This is a no.",
