  "reasoning": "First off, semiconductors are outside my circle of competence. I don\u2019t pretend to fully understand the fast-changing world of GPUs and AI chips \u2013 risk comes from not knowing what you\u2019re doing. While Nvidia boasts rock-solid operating margins (46%) and strong performance stability (86%), its ROE has never topped 15% in ten periods. That tells me pricing power is present, but the moat may be neither broad nor durable. Management has diluted shareholders with recent stock issuances and pays no meaningful dividend \u2013 capital allocation choices that give me pause. The balance sheet is reasonably conservative, yet earnings growth has been lumpy. On valuation, the three-stage DCF pegs intrinsic value at about $2,587 while the market cap implies a price nearly seven times higher \u2013 no margin of safety. For the long haul, I\u2019d rather own a simple business like Coca-Cola, Apple or BNSF at a fair price than a complex, cyclical chip maker at what amounts to a luxury valuation. Rule No.1: Never lose money. On this one, I\u2019ll pass.",
