  "reasoning": "1. Circle of Competence: Google operates in digital advertising auctions, complex AI systems, and regulated internet platforms\u2014well outside the simple, consumer-oriented businesses I understand, like See\u2019s Candies or Coca-Cola. \n2. Moat: It enjoys a strong network moat in search and data, but that\u2019s a technology moat I\u2019m cautious about. I prefer enduring consumer brand moats that don\u2019t hinge on ever-changing algorithms. \n3. Management: Sundar Pichai\u2019s team has shown capital discipline through buybacks, yet I haven\u2019t seen the owner-operator mindset and long-haul frugality I admire in our Berkshire managers. \n4. Financial Health: Alphabet boasts a fortress balance sheet with massive cash and consistent free cash flow, akin to the best industrials I respect, but big R&D swings can catch you by surprise. \n5. Valuation: With no reliable intrinsic value provided, there\u2019s no margin of safety\u2014reckless in my book. It\u2019s like buying a racehorse at asking price without ever seeing the track. \n6. Long-Term Prospects: AI battles, antitrust scrutiny, and shifting privacy rules pose red flags. I want predictability over the next 20 years, not hope. \n7. Comparison: Given a choice, I\u2019d own Coca-Cola or Procter & Gamble at fair value rather than a complex tech behemoth at an unknown price. When in doubt, the answer is usually no\u2014there\u2019s no penalty for missed opportunities.",
