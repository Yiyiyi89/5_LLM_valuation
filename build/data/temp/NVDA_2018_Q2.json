  "reasoning": "First things first, Nvidia sits well outside my circle of competence. Semiconductors and rapid hardware cycles are like trying to predict the weather \u2013 ever-changing and full of surprises. I\u2019ve stuck to businesses I understand: consumer staples, insurance, railroads, and the occasional tech exception in Apple\u2019s case, where I see a simple consumer ecosystem and switching costs.\n\nOn the moat front, it\u2019s a mixed bag. Those sky-high operating margins (65%) hint at pricing power, but cyclicality and only one out of ten years with ROE north of 15% show an inconsistent fortress. A durable moat? I\u2019m skeptical.\n\nManagement has put up decent results, yet recent share issuances dilute owners and they pay virtually no dividend. I want managers who act like owners; issuing stock to fuel growth isn\u2019t always a bad sign, but it\u2019s not a hallmark of frugal capital allocation either.\n\nFinancially, Nvidia scores okay on debt and margins, but the earnings picture is inconsistent \u2013 zero points on consistency. Manufacturing in this industry is capital-intensive and earnings swings can be brutal. That\u2019s a risk I don\u2019t relish.\n\nValuation is the clincher: my three-stage DCF pegs a conservative intrinsic value around $14,550 per share, yet the stock trades almost nine times that, leaving a negative margin of safety near 90%. As I always say, \u201cPrice is what you pay, value is what you get,\u201d and this price leaves your wallet a lot lighter than the business is worth.\n\nLong term? Technology pivots quickly. Today\u2019s leader can be tomorrow\u2019s footnote. When I compare this to owning Coca-Cola or Apple \u2013 businesses with steady cash flows, brands you see on Main Street, and moats you could drive a truck through \u2013 Nvidia doesn\u2019t measure up for Berkshire.\n\nIn my book, I\u2019d rather pass than risk permanent capital with scant margin for safety in a business I don\u2019t fully understand.",
