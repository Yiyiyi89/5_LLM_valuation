  "reasoning": "First off, Amazon isn\u2019t in my circle of competence. I like businesses I can understand from top to bottom \u2013 simple consumer products, insurance, railroads \u2013 not a mash-up of razor-thin retail and fast-moving cloud computing. Second, while they boast stellar operating margins (about 57%) hinting at some pricing power, their return on equity has been a mere 4.8% and ROIC under 2%, with earnings down 27% over ten periods. That\u2019s hardly a durable economic moat. Third, management has shown discipline in limiting share issuance but pays no dividends and carries debt to equity of 1.45, which stretches the balance sheet more than I prefer. Fourth, their financial performance is inconsistent: strong segments cushion weak ones, but I look for steadiness in earnings and return. Fifth, at a market cap north of $1.6\u2009trillion versus a conservative intrinsic value of roughly $144\u2009billion, there\u2019s no margin of safety \u2013 we\u2019re paying more than double what I calculate the business is worth. Sixth, while AWS may remain a cash cow and e-commerce keeps growing, complexity and competition loom large, and I\u2019d rather avoid businesses vulnerable to rapid tech change. Lastly, compared to the likes of Coca-Cola or See\u2019s Candies \u2013 wonderful businesses I can hold forever \u2013 Amazon simply doesn\u2019t meet my standards on valuation, simplicity, or predictability. In my book, that calls for a pass.",
