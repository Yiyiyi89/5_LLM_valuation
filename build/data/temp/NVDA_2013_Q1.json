  "reasoning": "First, Nvidia sits well outside my circle of competence. I\u2019ve spent my life understanding consumer brands, insurance, banks and railroads \u2013 not the intricacies of semiconductor architecture and AI workloads. Second, while Nvidia boasts eye-popping operating margins (over 60%), its return on equity (1.6%) and return on invested capital (1.2%) are sobering reminders that high margins don\u2019t always translate into high returns on capital. A true economic moat requires consistent returns, and Nvidia\u2019s ROE has only topped 15% zero times in the last ten periods. Pricing power may exist in the short run, but it hasn\u2019t produced the durable, decade-long moats I prize.\n\nManagement has done well to grow revenue, but recent share issuance and absence of dividends suggest capital allocation skewed toward reinvestment in a highly cyclical business. I prefer managers who think like owners and reward shareholders through sensible buybacks or dividends \u2013 see GEICO or See\u2019s Candies, where capital was returned wisely.\n\nOn financial health, debt is modest, but earnings consistency is lacking. Ten-period earnings growth fell 54.6%, and book value growth, though steady, is dwarfed by the erratic earnings pattern. I don\u2019t want to bet my name on unpredictable earnings cycles.\n\nFinally, the DCF intrinsic value near $982 versus market prices well above that leaves no margin of safety; paying a premium for potential future growth in a field I don\u2019t fully grasp feels like trying to catch a cat by the tail \u2013 you get scratched. \n\nCompared to the likes of Coca-Cola at a reasonable wage, or our insurance float generating reliable returns, Nvidia simply doesn\u2019t fit. I\u2019ll pass \u2013 I\u2019d rather sit on cash than risk permanent loss in a complex chip business that\u2019s expensive today and uncertain tomorrow.",
