  "reasoning": "Well, the very first question is whether Netflix falls into my circle of competence. I\u2019m fond of simple businesses I truly understand \u2013 consumer staples, banks, insurance, railroads \u2013 and I\u2019ve long steered clear of complex streaming platforms with ever-changing content costs and technology shifts. That alone sets off my guard.\n\nMoat: Netflix has a well-known brand and a global subscriber base, but the streaming business lacks the durable pricing power and switching costs of, say, Coca-Cola or Apple\u2019s ecosystem. Competition from deep-pocketed rivals (Disney+, Amazon, HBO Max) erodes any temporary edge. The moat looks more like a shallow trench.\n\nManagement: Reed Hastings and Ted Sarandos have done a fine job building subscriber counts, but management has plowed every penny back into content. I admire reinvestment, but I want capital allocation that rewards owners too. No dividends, limited buybacks, and enormous content spend raise questions about return on capital.\n\nFinancial Health & Consistency: Operating margins are strong (over 50%), yet ROE and ROIC are under 5% and wildly inconsistent. Owner earnings are negative ($\u201325/share), and the three-stage DCF spits out a negative intrinsic value. In my playbook, that\u2019s a flashing red light. Erratic earnings and occasional losses in owner earnings signal a financial fortress that\u2019s more like sandcastle.\n\nValuation: With an estimated intrinsic value that\u2019s negative \u2013 and a margin of safety of \u2013121% \u2013 the stock price sits well above anything I\u2019d consider paying. \u2018\u2018Price is what you pay, value is what you get,\u2019\u2019 and here the price vastly exceeds value.\n\nLong-Term Prospects & Red Flags: Streaming will remain competitive, capital-intensive, and subject to whims of content hits and subscriber churn. I want businesses that can prosper unchanged for decades, not ones reinventing how much they spend every year.\n\nOpportunity Cost: I\u2019d rather hold wonderful companies like Coca-Cola, Apple, or BNSF \u2013 businesses with proven moats, reliable owner earnings, and management teams that think like owners. Netflix, to me, looks like a fair business at a poor price.\n\nGiven all that, my signal is bearish.",
