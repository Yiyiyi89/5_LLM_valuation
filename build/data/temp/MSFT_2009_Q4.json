  "reasoning": "1. Circle of Competence: I have to admit right up front\u2014software businesses like Microsoft are outside my real circle of competence. I don\u2019t pretend to understand the fast-moving, ever-changing world of enterprise software and cloud services the way I do a Coca-Cola or a BNSF Railway. As I\u2019ve often said, risk comes from not knowing what you\u2019re doing.\n\n2. Competitive Moat: On paper Microsoft scores some points\u2014operating margins north of 85% and performance stability of 88.9% hint at a franchise with pricing power in Windows, Office and Azure. But ROE has never broken 15% in a decade, and earnings growth is uneven. I\u2019d call it a decent moat, but one that\u2019s been under pressure lately.\n\n3. Management Quality: Satya Nadella\u2019s team has executed well on cloud transition, yet recent share issuance and lack of dividends give me pause. I like managers who act like owners and return excess cash, as we saw at See\u2019s Candies or GEICO.\n\n4. Financial Health & Consistency: A 7.7% ROE, 1.0 debt-to-equity and ten-period earnings down 38% paint a spotty picture. A fortress balance sheet? Not here. I prefer minimal debt and more reliable returns on capital.\n\n5. Valuation vs. Intrinsic Value: The three-stage DCF pegs conservative intrinsic value at about $13,925, but the market values Microsoft well above that\u2014implying a negative margin of safety of 92.5%. As I always say, \u201cPrice is what you pay, value is what you get,\u201d and right now you\u2019re paying a premium that makes me uncomfortable.\n\n6. Long-Term Prospects & Red Flags: Technology moves in decades, but competition from AWS, Google, Oracle and others keeps margins and growth in flux. Historical owner earnings are a mile-high on paper, but assumptions here require a turnaround from negative growth today.\n\n7. Opportunity Cost: I\u2019d rather own a wonderful business at a fair price than a fair business at a wonderful price. With Coca-Cola, Apple (in my mind a consumer products play), Bank of America, BNSF or See\u2019s Candies sitting in my stable, Microsoft simply doesn\u2019t offer the durable advantages or margin of safety I demand.\n\nBottom line: Microsoft may be a fine company, but for me it\u2019s outside my wheelhouse, overvalued, and lacking the financial steadiness I look for. I\u2019ll say no for now.",
