  "reasoning": "First off, Amazon sits outside my circle of competence. I understand simple, wide-moat businesses like Coca-Cola or See\u2019s Candies, but the moving parts of e-commerce algorithms and cloud-computing pricing are more complex than I care to dive into. On the moat front, AWS gives Amazon some pricing power, but the inconsistent ROE (just 4.7%) and spotty earnings growth show a moat that isn\u2019t as durable as the ones I cherish. Management is smart\u2014Jeff Bezos and Andy Jassy allocate capital aggressively\u2014but they pour most owner earnings back into growth, with minimal dividends and a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.6 that gives me pause. Financially, operating margins look strong at 25%, but the weak ROIC (1.8%) and uneven earnings pattern raise red flags. The DCF pegs intrinsic value at about $585, yet shares trade well above that with virtually no margin of safety. While Amazon may prosper, I\u2019d rather stick with proven, easy-to-understand businesses at fair prices than overpay for complexity. No regrets passing on this one.",
