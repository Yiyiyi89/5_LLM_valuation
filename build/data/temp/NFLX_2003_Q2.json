  "reasoning": "1. Circle of Competence: I don\u2019t claim to fully understand the ins and outs of digital content distribution and subscriber churn in a fast-changing tech environment. Unlike Coca-Cola or Apple\u2019s consumer ecosystem, Netflix sits outside my circle.\n2. Competitive Moat: While Netflix has scale and brand recognition, its moat looks shallow. There\u2019s fierce competition from Disney+, Amazon Prime, HBO Max and countless new entrants. Content libraries get licensed and copied; pricing power is limited.\n3. Management Quality: Hastings and crew have executed well on growth, but capital allocation is heavy on content spend with little in dividends or buybacks. High debt to equity (0.53) suggests financial leverage over shareholder returns.\n4. Financial Health & Consistency: Operating margins are strong (62%), but ROE is weak at 3.4% and ROIC troughs at 2.2%. Earnings growth is inconsistent, flagging unpredictable results. No visible margin of safety in the balance sheet.\n5. Valuation vs. Intrinsic Value: A conservative DCF pegs intrinsic value at $38, but the stock is trading well above that, yielding a negative margin of safety of nearly 93%. I\u2019d rather pay a fair price for a wonderful business than a dear price for a fair one.\n6. Long-Term Prospects & Red Flags: Streaming economics face rising content costs, subscriber saturation in key markets, and low switching costs. The debt load and inconsistent return metrics raise red flags about sustainable returns over 20 years.\n7. Portfolio Comparison: I\u2019d much rather own long-standing franchises like Coca-Cola or Apple with strong pricing power, clean balance sheets, steady cash flow and simple economics. Netflix simply doesn\u2019t measure up.\nIn my view, this is not a business I\u2019d hold forever, and the price is too rich for the modest moat it offers. I\u2019ll pass.",
