  "reasoning": "First off, Google sits outside my circle of competence. I understand simple consumer products and insurance like the back of my hand, but the nitty-gritty of search algorithms, online advertising auctions, and advanced machine learning is a different kettle of fish. I\u2019d rather say \u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019 than pretend I do.\n\nOn the moat front, Alphabet enjoys a meaningful network effect: search feeds more data into the system, which refines results and pulls in more users and advertisers. That\u2019s akin to owning a toll bridge across the digital marketplace. But it\u2019s an intangible moat built on code and regulations, which can be chipped away by competition or government action.\n\nManagement under Sundar Pichai has shown creativity and ambition. They\u2019ve built Google into a cash-generating powerhouse and have little debt\u2014two traits I admire. Still, they plow billions into moonshots (Waymo, Verily) where capital returns are far from certain. I\u2019d like to see more consistent, shareholder-friendly allocation rather than experiments that may take decades, if ever, to pay off.\n\nFinancially, Alphabet is rock solid. Generating massive free cash flow, hoarding plenty of cash on the balance sheet, and keeping leverage low. But its earnings are heavily tied to advertising; any major shift in consumer behavior or ad regulation could dent the top line.\n\nWith the data at hand, we lack a reliable intrinsic value estimate, and Google often trades at a premium that assumes perfection. When you don\u2019t understand the fundamentals deeply enough, any premium becomes a risk you might live to regret.\n\nLooking out 20 years, digital advertising will persist but face headwinds: privacy laws, antitrust scrutiny, rising competition in cloud computing, and changing consumer habits. These aren\u2019t fatal flaws, but they introduce uncertainty in what should be an enduring, steadily compounding business.\n\nCompared to opportunities I\u2019ve held\u2014Coca-Cola, See\u2019s Candies, Apple as a consumer play\u2014Google simply doesn\u2019t fit my sweet spot. I\u2019d rather sit on my hands than risk permanent capital loss on complexity I don\u2019t truly grasp.",
