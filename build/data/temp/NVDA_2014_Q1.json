  "reasoning": "First, I have to admit semiconductor cycles aren\u2019t in my circle of competence. I don\u2019t pretend to understand the ups and downs of GPU pricing, node transitions, or wafer economics the way I understand grocery brands, railroads, or consumer ecosystems like Apple\u2019s. \n\nSecond, on the moat front NVIDIA shows strong operating margins\u2014around 60%\u2014which hints at pricing power, but its ROE has been weak and inconsistent. A durable moat should deliver double-digit ROEs year in and year out; NVIDIA\u2019s only managed that in 0 out of 10 periods. That tells me any advantage is vulnerable in a fast-evolving industry. \n\nThird, management has taken on moderate debt and issued new shares recently, diluting existing owners. They\u2019ve plowed cash into R&D, which is necessary, but I want capital stewards who think like owners and pay common dividends when they can. That\u2019s not in evidence here. \n\nFourth, financial consistency is lacking. Return on invested capital has been under 2%, debt-to-equity is 0.65, and earnings growth has been uneven. I prefer predictable cash flows the way GEICO or See\u2019s Candies generate them. \n\nFifth, the valuation is simply too rich. Your DCF pegs intrinsic value at about $2,091 per share but the market implies a near-80% premium. That leaves no margin of safety. I\u2019d rather own a mediocre business at a sensible price than an exciting one at a sky-high price. \n\nSixth, semiconductors face relentless technology shifts and fierce global competition\u2014heavy capital intensity with boom-and-bust swings. That\u2019s a red flag for a buy-and-hold investor looking decades out. \n\nFinally, compared to opportunities I\u2019m comfortable with\u2014Coca-Cola\u2019s brand, Apple\u2019s ecosystem, Bank of America\u2019s franchise\u2014NVIDIA doesn\u2019t align with my playbook. I\u2019ll pass and stick to what I know. There\u2019s no penalty for waiting.",
