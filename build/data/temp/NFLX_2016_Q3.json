  "reasoning": "First off, NFLX sits outside my circle of competence. I\u2019m comfortable with businesses I can lay out on a cocktail napkin \u2013 soft drinks, insurance, railroads \u2013 not complex content licensing and subscriber math. As I always say, \u201cRisk comes from not knowing what you\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nCompetitive Moat: Netflix shows decent operating margins (~31%), but its moat is far from unassailable. Content costs balloon, competitors (Disney, Amazon, HBO) pile in, and customer switching costs are thin unless you\u2019re bundled with broadband. High performance stability (70%) is encouraging, but inconsistent ROE (0/10 periods above 15%) tells me the economic moat isn\u2019t durable.\n\nManagement & Capital Allocation: Reed Hastings has built a global brand, but heavy debt (debt/equity ~3.9) to fund content raises a red flag. No dividends or share buybacks ease this, but I prefer managers who think like owners and don\u2019t lever up the balance sheet so aggressively.\n\nFinancial Health & Consistency: Weak ROE (2%), negligible ROIC (~0.4%), and inconsistent earnings (-27.5% over ten periods) clash with my idea of a financial fortress. I\u2019d rather own See\u2019s Candies \u2013 predictable cash flow, little debt, steady returns.\n\nValuation: My DCF pegs a conservative intrinsic value at $403, yet NFLX trades well above that. With a margin of safety at \u201399%, I\u2019d be overpaying by a wide margin. Remember, \u201cPrice is what you pay, value is what you get.\u201d\n\nLong-Term Prospects & Red Flags: Streaming will mature, competition intensify, and content spending could erode returns. I prefer businesses with pricing power \u2013 one where I can raise prices without scaring away customers. That\u2019s not the case here.\n\nComparison to Portfolio: I\u2019d rather redeploy capital into Coca-Cola\u2019s dependable dividends or Apple\u2019s ecosystem moat. NFLX might entertain millions, but it doesn\u2019t fit my criteria for a forever business purchased at a sensible price.\n\nBottom line: I\u2019ll pass. There\u2019s no penalty for missing an opportunity, but losing principal by chasing a too-expensive, debt-laden content play? That\u2019s a mistake I\u2019m unwilling to make.",
