  "reasoning": "1. Circle of Competence: This streaming business sits squarely outside my wheelhouse. I\u2019ve built my record on simple consumer staples, insurance, railroads and the like\u2014not the complex world of content licensing, global streaming technology and subscriber churn. As I\u2019ve said, \"Risk comes from not knowing what you\u2019re doing,\" and I simply don\u2019t know this circus well enough to place my chips.\n2. Competitive Moat: Netflix once boasted first-mover advantage, but the moat is eroding fast. New deep-pocketed rivals\u2014from Disney and Amazon to Apple\u2014are investing billions in content. I see no durable pricing power or switching costs strong enough to keep churn at bay over decades.\n3. Management Quality: Reed Hastings is a creative force, but recurrent stock issuances and the absence of dividends suggest a preference for growth at the expense of shareholder predictability. I like managers who think like owners and allocate capital conservatively; heavy dilution is a red flag in my book.\n4. Financial Health & Consistency: A negative ROE and ROIC are concerning\u2014even with a tidy operating margin, the business has yet to generate consistent returns on capital. Netflix\u2019s debt-to-equity of about 0.4 isn\u2019t alarming, but without reliable free cash flow or a history of steady earnings, there\u2019s no financial fortress here.\n5. Valuation: We lack a credible intrinsic value estimate and margin of safety. Paying up for high expectations in an industry rife with unpredictability strikes me as a recipe for permanent capital loss.\n6. Long-Term Prospects & Red Flags: Content costs continue to escalate, competition is intensifying, and subscriber growth will slow in saturated markets. I\u2019d rather own a business that tomorrow can raise prices without losing customers\u2014a luxury Netflix may not enjoy.\n7. Comparative Opportunity: I\u2019d prefer to redeploy capital into businesses like Coca-Cola, Apple, or BNSF, where I understand the economics, see durable moats and strong balance sheets, and can sleep at night. In short, Netflix isn\u2019t a bet I\u2019m willing to make. I\u2019ll pass and wait for simpler, more predictable opportunities.",
