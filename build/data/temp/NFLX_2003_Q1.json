  "reasoning": "First off, Netflix sits well outside my circle of competence. I\u2019ve always steered clear of complex technology and content\u2010creation businesses \u2013 they\u2019re a lot like trying to predict the weather. I\u2019m more comfortable with simple, reliable consumer products or banks, not a streaming service burning billions on original shows with no guarantee of viewer loyalty. \n\nWhen I look for an economic moat, I seek durable advantages \u2013 brands that can raise prices without losing customers or infrastructure no one can replicate. Netflix does have scale and a recognizable name, but so do Disney, Amazon and countless others willing to undercut on price or pile into content. There\u2019s no clear pricing power when churn can spike the moment consumers spot a better deal elsewhere. \n\nAs for management, Reed Hastings and his team have shown some discipline by not slicing up the equity or handing out dividends. Yet they\u2019re plowing cash into content like there\u2019s no tomorrow. That may drive growth, but it\u2019s hard for me to see how heavy content spending translates into lasting returns on capital. Their ROE is negative, and return on invested capital is in the red \u2013 hardly signals of masterful capital allocation. \n\nOn the balance sheet they aren\u2019t overleveraged, and operating margins look respectable. But earnings have been all over the map, and owner earnings are effectively zero after you strip out content commitments. I like consistency in results, not wild swings. \n\nValuation? The three\u2010stage DCF pegs intrinsic value around $6 a share, and even a generous haircut gives you a $5 fair price. At a market cap north of $350 billion, Netflix is trading at nearly 60 times any sensible cash flow measure. That leaves you with a negative margin of safety of about 98%. Paying a high price for an uncertain business is a recipe for disappointment. \n\nIn my view, I\u2019d rather own solid consumer franchises like Coca-Cola or my Apple position \u2013 businesses I understand and that can be held \u2018forever.\u2019 Netflix may entertain millions, but I wouldn\u2019t entrust it with my capital. Therefore, I\u2019m bearish on NFLX.",
