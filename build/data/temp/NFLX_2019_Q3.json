  "reasoning": "1. Circle of Competence: I don\u2019t understand Netflix the way I understand Coca-Cola or a railroad. Streaming is a rapidly changing, capital-intensive business with content rights, technology platforms, and fickle consumer tastes. As I\u2019ve said, \u2018Risk comes from not knowing what you\u2019re doing.\u2019\n2. Economic Moat: Operating margins around 41% suggest some pricing power, but inconsistent ROE (only 0 of 10 periods above 15%) and choppy earnings growth point to a weak, unstable moat. Subscribers can jump to another service whenever they like\u2014far from the durable brands in my circle.\n3. Management & Capital Allocation: I see no dividends and heavy debt (debt/equity of 3.5). Management plows cash into content, which may grow subscribers but leaves shareholders with no tangible returns today. I admire frugality and owner-oriented behavior\u2014Netflix\u2019s approach is the opposite.\n4. Financial Health & Consistency: A ROE under 10%, ROIC of 2%, and erratic earnings growth hurt my heart. They\u2019ve grown book value, but at what cost? A mountain of debt raises the risk of permanent impairment if subscriber growth stalls.\n5. Valuation vs. Intrinsic Value: Your DCF pegs intrinsic value at $8,707 per share but the stock trades well above that (MOS \u201392%). Paying nearly double intrinsic value leaves no margin of safety. \u2018It\u2019s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.\u2019\n6. Long-Term Prospects & Red Flags: Content spending will remain heavy, competition intensifies, and consumer preferences shift. With little visible pricing power moat and high leverage, long-term prospects look uncertain.\n7. Comparison to My Portfolio: I\u2019d rather own See\u2019s Candies, Coca-Cola, or BNSF\u2014businesses I understand with enduring advantages\u2014than a speculative tech-flavored content producer. When in doubt, I say no.",
