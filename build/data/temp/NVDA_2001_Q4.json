  "reasoning": "First off, I\u2019d be the first to say that Nvidia operates in a business I don\u2019t fully understand\u2009\u2013\u2009semiconductors and GPU architecture is outside my circle of competence.  As I\u2019ve often said, \u201crisk comes from not knowing what you\u2019re doing,\u201d and I\u2019d rather stick to what I know: consumer brands, insurance, banks, railroads and the like.  \n\nOn the moat front, Nvidia does enjoy strong operating margins (an impressive 37.6% average), suggesting some pricing power in its high-end chips.  But its return on equity tells a different story \u2013 only 10% last period and never over 15% in seven tries.  To me, that\u2019s more of a narrow moat vulnerable to fierce competition from AMD and Intel than an unassailable fortress.  \n\nManagement has needed to issue new shares recently, diluting existing owners, and they pay no dividends.  I like capital allocators who think like owners; issuing stock to chase growth makes me uneasy.  \n\nFinancially, the balance sheet carries a debt-to-equity around 1.0, ROIC is only about 5%, and earnings growth has been erratic.  Inconsistent ownership returns and cyclical swings are more ingredients for sea sickness than for a calm cruise.  \n\nMy discounted cash flow pegs intrinsic value at about $151 a share (or $128 on a conservative basis), yet current prices demand close to a full turn over my estimate.  That leaves no margin of safety \u2013 indeed a negative one \u2013 and I\u2019d rather pay fair than overpay.  \n\nLastly, GPUs are subject to rapid technology changes and cyclicality I can\u2019t forecast with confidence.  Compared to owning Coca-Cola, See\u2019s Candies or BNSF for the next fifty years at a sensible price, Nvidia just doesn\u2019t make the cut.  \u201cWhen in doubt, the answer is NO,\u201d so I\u2019ll sit this one out.",
