  "reasoning": "First things first, semiconductors aren\u2019t in my circle of competence. I like businesses I can wrap my mind around \u2013 railroads, insurance, consumer brands \u2013 not the gyrations of chips and complex technology. When you don\u2019t understand the engine under the hood, you risk losing money.\n\nLooking at NVDA\u2019s moat, you\u2019ve got nice operating margins around 31%, but that hasn\u2019t translated into a consistent return on equity \u2013 ROE is stuck at 2.1%, with only 0 of 10 periods above 15%. That tells me any competitive edge is fleeting, and they\u2019ve yet to prove durable pricing power.\n\nOn management and capital allocation, there\u2019s been no big dividend, no share issuance, but also no clear shareholder\u2010friendly actions. It\u2019s hard to give them credit when profits have been erratic.\n\nFinancially, the company\u2019s weak ROE, high debt-to-equity of 0.8, inconsistent earnings growth (-36.4% over 10 periods) and lack of liquidity data flag a shaky foundation. I like financial fortresses, not roller-coaster balance sheets.\n\nValuation is where it gets downright unattractive. A DCF pegs intrinsic value at about $110 per share with a conservative haircut, yet the margin of safety is deeply negative (\u201394%). You\u2019re paying way more than the business is worth.\n\nLong term, I\u2019d worry about cycles, fierce competition and rapid technology change \u2013 all ingredients for value erosion. I\u2019d rather own a wonderful business at a fair price than a complicated business at any price.\n\nPut simply, I don\u2019t see NVDA fitting alongside Coca-Cola or Apple in my portfolio. I\u2019ll pass.",
