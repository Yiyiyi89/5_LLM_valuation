  "reasoning": "First off, I\u2019d tell you right away that Netflix is outside my circle of competence. I don\u2019t make a habit of investing in content\u2010streaming businesses because they\u2019re a blend of fast-changing technology, fickle consumer tastes and heavy programming costs. That alone makes me uneasy.\n\nWhen I look for an economic moat, I want pricing power or enduring brand strength \u2013 think Coca-Cola or See\u2019s Candies. Netflix has decent operating margins around 33\u2009%, but its ROE (3.8\u2009%) and ROIC (2.3\u2009%) are weak, and it\u2019s shown inconsistent earnings growth (down 65\u2009% over the last ten periods). That\u2019s not a durable competitive advantage in my book.\n\nManagement has issued shares recently, diluting existing owners, and they pay no dividend. I prefer teams that think like owners, hoarding cash and buying back stock when it\u2019s cheap \u2013 GEICO and Wells Fargo come to mind.\n\nOn financial health, Netflix carries a 0.65 debt/equity load with choppy earnings. A strong balance sheet to me means low debt and consistent, predictable profits \u2013 neither of which Netflix delivers. The strong book value growth is a silver lining, but uneven earnings outweigh it.\n\nValuation is the final nail. My conservative DCF pegs intrinsic value around $126 per share. The market is trading well above that, giving a negative margin of safety of nearly 93\u2009%. I\u2019d rather wait for a much larger discount than chase a high-flying stock.\n\nLong term, competition from Disney+, Prime, HBO Max and possible shifts in consumer habits pose big risks. I\u2019d own a wonderful business at a fair price, not a fair business at a wonderful price. Compared to what\u2019s out there in my portfolio \u2013 Coca-Cola\u2019s brand, Apple\u2019s ecosystem, BNSF\u2019s rail advantage \u2013 Netflix simply doesn\u2019t measure up.\n\nIn short, I say no. There\u2019s no penalty for waiting, and plenty of better opportunities within my circle of competence.",
