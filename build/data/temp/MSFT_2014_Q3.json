  "reasoning": "First off, I\u2019ve got to admit that software and complex technology aren\u2019t really in my circle of competence \u2013 \"Risk comes from not knowing what you\u2019re doing\" \u2013 and I don\u2019t know this business as well as I know my soft-drink buddies or railroad tracks. While Microsoft has one of the strongest operating margins I\u2019ve ever seen (nearly 77.5%), the fundamentals here are inconsistent: ROE averages under 7%, ROIC around 3.6%, and earnings have fallen roughly 14.6% over the last ten periods.\n\nMoat? There\u2019s something to be said for a vast enterprise software ecosystem and switching costs, and stable margins hint at competitive advantages. But true \"durable moats\" show up in consistent double-digit returns on equity year after year \u2013 and we don\u2019t see that here.\n\nManagement has fluffed capital allocation by diluting shareholders with new stock and has largely skipped dividends \u2013 not the sort of owner-friendly behavior I prize at See\u2019s Candies or GEICO.\n\nThe balance sheet carries a debt-to-equity ratio north of 0.8, and the inconsistent cash flows underscore a lack of financial fortress stability. A three-stage DCF pegs intrinsic value conservatively at about $35,900 per share, implying a nearly 90% negative margin of safety at today's prices.\n\nLong term, I remain wary of rapid technology change and competition from cloud rivals. I\u2019d rather own wonderful businesses like Coca-Cola or BNSF at fair prices than tap-dancing on overpriced software platforms I don\u2019t fully grasp. So I\u2019ll pass here \u2013 this isn\u2019t a place I want to put my permanent capital.",
