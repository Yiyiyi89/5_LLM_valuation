  "reasoning": "First things first, Nvidia is a semiconductor and high-performance computing company \u2013 a kind of business I\u2019ve long said I don\u2019t fully understand. My circle of competence runs to simple consumer franchises, insurance, banks, railroads and the occasional utility. Nvidia\u2019s GPU-driven AI world is far more complex than I care to wade into.  \n\nAs for a moat, the company boasts powerful operating margins (roughly 44%) and high performance stability (82%), suggesting some pricing power. But without consistent ROE (0 of 10 periods above 15%) and with cyclicality in chips and Moore\u2019s Law lurking around every corner, I\u2019d question whether this advantage is durable in twenty years.  \n\nManagement has delivered strong revenue growth, yet has diluted shareholders with recent stock issuance and pays no meaningful dividend. I like owners who think like partners; issuing shares to fuel growth isn\u2019t a crime, but it\u2019s not quite the capital discipline I reward in businesses like See\u2019s Candies or GEICO.  \n\nFinancially, Nvidia\u2019s debt levels are conservative and margins look terrific, but its ROIC (6%) and ROE (8%) aren\u2019t what I\u2019d consider exceptional for a business with rapid technology change. And earnings growth, while dramatic on the upside, has been inconsistent \u2013 I prefer a more dependable record.  \n\nOn valuation, the three-stage DCF pegs intrinsic value around $1,780 a share after a 15% haircut, implying a roughly 84% gap to today\u2019s market price. My margin of safety is nowhere to be found at this valuation.  \n\nLooking ahead, AI may offer handsome tailwinds, but technological leadership is fleeting and capital requirements are steep. I\u2019d rather own a wonderful business at a fair price than a fair business at a wonderful price.  \n\nCompared to opportunities in my portfolio \u2013 Coca-Cola, Apple, Bank of America \u2013 Nvidia simply sits outside my wheelhouse and trades at a premium I can\u2019t reconcile with my circle of competence, margin of safety and long-term mindset. On that basis, I\u2019d pass and keep my powder dry.",
