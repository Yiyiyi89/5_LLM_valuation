  "reasoning": "1. Circle of Competence: I\u2019ll be honest \u2013 streaming video is outside my circle of competence. I understand consumer products like Coca-Cola or Apple\u2019s ecosystem; I don\u2019t profess to understand the long-term economics of high-stakes content wars and technology-driven distribution. Risk comes from not knowing what you\u2019re doing.  \n2. Moat: Netflix has built a formidable brand and subscriber base, but its moat looks shallow. Strong operating margins (37%) and pricing power in the short term don\u2019t guarantee a durable advantage. Content costs are rising, and global competitors from Disney to Amazon are pouring in capital.  \n3. Management & Capital Allocation: Reed Hastings is a creative executive, but Netflix\u2019s debt-to-equity ratio of 3.7 and reinvestment of virtually every dollar of earnings into content leaves me uneasy. There are no dividends, and capital allocation focuses on growth at the expense of returns.  \n4. Financial Health & Consistency: ROE of 8% and ROIC of 1.7% are modest for a perceived high-growth business. Earnings growth is erratic, and the balance sheet carries heavy leverage. I prefer companies with consistent, predictable returns and minimal debt.  \n5. Valuation vs. Intrinsic Value: My three-stage DCF pegs a conservative intrinsic value near $5,143 per share and shows a margin of safety of \u201396.6%. In simple terms, you\u2019re paying almost double what the business is worth by my estimate. I will not bet where I can\u2019t find a margin of safety.  \n6. Long-Term Prospects & Red Flags: The streaming market is hyper-competitive and capital-intensive. Without a clear moat or pricing lever strong enough to offset content inflation, long-term returns will be uncertain.  \n7. Opportunity Cost: I\u2019d rather own Coca-Cola\u2019s steady cash flow or Bank of America\u2019s conservative financing franchises. There are plenty of wonderful businesses trading at fair prices; Netflix is not one of them.  \nIn short, Netflix lies outside my comfort zone, carries too much debt, offers inconsistent returns, and trades well above what I consider its intrinsic value. My answer is a firm no.",
