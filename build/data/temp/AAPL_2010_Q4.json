  "reasoning": "First and foremost, Apple is right in my circle of competence \u2013 I understand consumer products and strong brands, and Apple\u2019s ecosystem is a textbook example of switching costs at work. That said, a durable moat requires more than a nice ecosystem, and the data show some cracks. Despite rock-solid operating margins north of 38%, Apple\u2019s ROE has only topped 15% in zero out of ten periods, and its earnings growth pattern is inconsistent. A pricing power moat is suggested by stable margins, but an inconsistent ROE record undercuts the notion of a truly unassailable franchise. Management has shown honesty and discipline in the past, but recent stock issuance raises a small red flag on capital allocation, and with minimal dividends paid out, I\u2019d like to see a cleaner track record on returning cash to shareholders. On the financial fortress front, Apple\u2019s high debt-to-equity of 0.6 is manageable for a giant, but paired with uneven earnings growth, it gives me pause. Intrinsic-value work yields about $49,600 per share on a conservative basis, implying a margin of safety of around \u201380% at today\u2019s price. I\u2019d rather own a wonderful business at a fair price than pay up for greatness. In my portfolio, I have the likes of Coca-Cola and See\u2019s Candies with similar moats at far more attractive prices. A compelling long-term prospect, yes \u2013 but right here and now, the price is too steep. Therefore, I wouldn\u2019t buy.",
