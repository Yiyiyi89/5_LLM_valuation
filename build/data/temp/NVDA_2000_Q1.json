I didn\u2019t build my record by trying to call the next shift in GPU node geometry or AI training algorithms \u2014 \u2018risk comes from not knowing what you\u2019re doing,\u2019 and I simply don\u2019t understand the wafer-fab business and rapid technology cycles well enough to predict winners and losers. \n\nOn the surface NVIDIA has built a strong franchise in graphics and AI chips, and you could argue that it has a moat around its CUDA ecosystem and developer base. Management under Jensen Huang has been aggressive in R&D and seems to allocate capital skillfully, but I don\u2019t have sufficient insight into how they make those decisions or steer through competitive threats from AMD, Intel and a host of emerging AI-chip players. \n\nFinancially, the headlines may shout explosive growth, but I see no consistent earnings history here to analyze, no book-value metrics, and no reliable intrinsic-value estimates in the data you\u2019ve provided. That lack of visibility means no margin of safety for me. \n\nLong term, AI sounds promising, but technology moves faster than a freight train and often leaves investors stranded. I much prefer businesses like Coca-Cola or BNSF Railway where I can reasonably forecast a decade or two out. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll pass \u2014 I\u2019d rather sit on my hands than risk permanent loss by venturing into a semiconductor business I don\u2019t fully grasp and can\u2019t properly value.",
