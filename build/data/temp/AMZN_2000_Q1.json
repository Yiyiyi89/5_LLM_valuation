  "reasoning": "1. Circle of Competence: Amazon straddles both retail and complex technology (AWS, advertising, logistics algorithms). I\u2019ve spent my life in simple consumer goods and straightforward infrastructure \u2013 I don\u2019t fully grasp the interplay of its cloud-computing arm or digital ad business. As I\u2019ve said, \u201cRisk comes from not knowing what you\u2019re doing.\u201d\n2. Competitive Moat: On the surface Amazon has scale in e-commerce, a Prime ecosystem and a network effect in AWS. Those are promising, but with no data on margins, growth rates or customer retention I can\u2019t size the moat.\n3. Management Quality: Jeff Bezos built something extraordinary, and Andy Jassy has big shoes. But with zero management analysis here, I can\u2019t judge their capital-allocation discipline or shareholder alignment.\n4. Financial Health: There\u2019s no balance-sheet, earnings history or debt information provided. A fortress needs solid walls \u2013 I\u2019m staring at empty blueprints.\n5. Valuation: Without an intrinsic value estimate or margin of safety, I have no idea if I\u2019d be paying a fair price for this business.\n6. Long-Term Prospects & Red Flags: Retail and cloud will be around, but technological change is rapid and competition fierce. No metrics mean too many unknowns.\n7. Comparison to My Portfolio: I\u2019d rather own See\u2019s Candies, Coca-Cola or GEICO, where I understand the economics cold. When in doubt, the answer is usually no.",
