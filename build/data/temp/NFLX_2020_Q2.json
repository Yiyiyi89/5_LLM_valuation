  "reasoning": "First off, Netflix isn\u2019t in my circle of competence. I\u2019ve spent my life buying simple, predictable businesses\u2014I know fizzy drinks, insurance and railroads, not streaming platforms in an ever-changing tech landscape. Next, while Netflix shows strong operating margins and some pricing power, its return on equity has only averaged 7.7%\u2014hardly a durable moat when you need 15%-plus in good years. Management hasn\u2019t issued much stock or paid dividends, which is fine, but they\u2019ve loaded up the balance sheet with a debt-to-equity ratio of about 3.0. That makes me uneasy when interest rates rise. The company\u2019s earnings growth is inconsistent, too\u2014zero points for steadiness, despite a 148% jump over ten periods. On valuation, the three-stage DCF pegs a conservative intrinsic value near $8,600 a share, yet Netflix trades well above that\u2014leaving a deeply negative margin of safety. Long term, fierce competition from deep-pocketed rivals and the streaming arms race cloud the outlook. Given the 10% discount rate I use and better opportunities in my portfolio\u2014from Coca-Cola\u2019s pricing power to Apple\u2019s sticky ecosystem\u2014I\u2019m going to pass. There\u2019s no shame in walking away from a business I don\u2019t fully understand or at a price I can\u2019t justify.",
