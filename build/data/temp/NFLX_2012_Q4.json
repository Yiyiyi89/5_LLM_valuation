  "reasoning": "1. Circle of Competence: I\u2019ve spent my life in businesses I understand\u2014insurance, railroads, consumer staples, banks\u2014none of which look like high-flying streaming services. As I\u2019ve often said, \u201cRisk comes from not knowing what you\u2019re doing,\u201d and I simply don\u2019t have a deep handle on the content-production arms race and the shifting sands of subscriber churn. This one falls outside my circle.\n\n2. Competitive Moat: Netflix certainly has scale and brand recognition, but the numbers tell me their advantage isn\u2019t all that durable. Their return on equity has averaged barely over 1%, and they\u2019ve only posted ROE north of 15% in half of the last ten periods. That suggests a moat more leaky than we\u2019d like at Berkshire.\n\n3. Management & Capital Allocation: Reed Hastings and Ted Sarandos have built a compelling subscriber machine, but the balance sheet is stretched. A debt-to-equity ratio over 4 to 1 and negative owner earnings \u2014 roughly \u2013$6.6 billion \u2014 give me pause. At Berkshire, we like to see honest managers who build earnings rather than borrow to chase growth.\n\n4. Financial Health & Consistency: Earnings have been all over the map, with a 79% decline over ten periods in total growth. You don\u2019t get rich in investing by predicting zig-zag earnings. We prefer businesses with steady earnings power, not roller-coaster results.\n\n5. Valuation vs. Intrinsic Value: A three-stage DCF spits out a negative intrinsic value\u2014hard to argue for buying a stock whose discounted future owner earnings are in the red. No margin of safety here; the model suggests you\u2019re overpaying even if management somehow turns a corner.\n\n6. Long-term Prospects & Red Flags: Streaming is cut-throat\u2014Disney+, Amazon, Apple TV+, and an endless lineup of new competitors. Content costs are skyrocketing, and subscriber churn is a fickle beast. Without pricing power to raise subscription fees without losing customers, this business can\u2019t consistently earn superior returns.\n\n7. Portfolio Comparison: I\u2019d much rather own Coca-Cola, See\u2019s Candies, Apple, or Bank of America\u2014businesses with simple models, strong moats, fortress balance sheets, and consistent cash flows. When I\u2019m in doubt, the answer is usually \u201cno.\u201d In this case, the prudent thing is to sit on the sidelines. There\u2019s no penalty for missed opportunities, only for permanent loss of capital.",
