  "reasoning": "First off, streaming video services like Netflix fall outside my circle of competence. I\u2019ve spent my career investing in businesses I thoroughly understand\u2014consumer staples, railroads, insurance\u2014and Netflix is essentially a high-content, high-tech platform with capital-intensive content spending. That said, even by general standards Netflix\u2019s competitive moat looks thin. It has some scale in subscriber numbers, but intense competition from Disney, Amazon, and Apple means customers can\u2014and will\u2014jump ship on a price hike. There\u2019s no enduring pricing power in a market teeming with alternatives.\n\nOn management and capital allocation, I see a company levering up with a debt-to-equity ratio north of 4.3 and producing negligible owner earnings. Borrowing to fund original programming is no sin if it generates consistent free cash flow, but Netflix\u2019s owner earnings are negative and management pays no dividend or repurchases stock\u2014hardly a sign they\u2019re thinking like owners. Financially, a 1.1% ROE, erratic earnings growth down 82% over ten periods, and unreported current ratio are red flags. The only bright spot is book value growth at 16% CAGR, but that masks cash burn on the content front.\n\nValuation is the final straw. A DCF spits out a negative intrinsic value and a negative margin of safety\u2014meaning you\u2019re paying for losses, not earnings. I\u2019d rather own a wonderful business at a fair price than Netflix at any price. Long-term prospects hinge on endless content arms races and subscriber churn, not durable moats or dependable cash flows. Compared to Coca-Cola, Apple, or BNSF, Netflix simply doesn\u2019t offer the predictability or margin of safety I demand. In short, I\u2019ll pass.",
