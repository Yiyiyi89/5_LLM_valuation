  "reasoning": "1. Circle of Competence: Streaming video services aren\u2019t in my wheelhouse. I stick to simple, predictable businesses like Coca-Cola, insurance and utilities. Netflix is tied up in a fast-changing tech and content world I don\u2019t claim to understand fully.\n\n2. Moat: While Netflix has a huge subscriber base and some original content cachet, its low and inconsistent ROE (3.3% average) and ROIC (2.3%) tell me its competitive edge is thin. In my experience, a durable moat shows up in steady double-digit returns on capital, which Netflix lacks.\n\n3. Management & Capital Allocation: Reed Hastings and his team have driven growth, but they continue to plow cash into content with no dividend or buybacks to show for it. Owner earnings are negative ($-57/share) and intrinsic value calculations come up deeply underwater. That\u2019s not how I like to see capital put to work.\n\n4. Financial Health & Consistency: Earnings growth is up and down, operating margins look healthy at 53%, but overall earnings and free cash flow are inconsistent. A fortress balance sheet for me means reliable owner earnings over cycles, and Netflix\u2019s swings make me uneasy.\n\n5. Valuation vs. Intrinsic Value: A three-stage DCF spits out a negative intrinsic value (\u2013$866 under conservative assumptions) and a negative margin of safety. In plain English, you\u2019re paying for a business that doesn\u2019t appear to generate predictable excess returns.\n\n6. Long-Term Prospects & Red Flags: The streaming market is crowded\u2014Disney+, Amazon Prime, Apple TV+ and countless others. Heavy content spending, fierce pricing wars and subscriber churn all represent ongoing risks. I\u2019d rather own a candy business that raises prices than a capital-hungry content operation.\n\n7. Opportunity Cost: I\u2019d rather put my money into durable brands like Coca-Cola or Apple\u2014businesses I understand and can hold \u201cforever.\u201d Netflix simply doesn\u2019t fit my criteria of a high-return, low-risk enterprise available at a sensible price.\n\nConclusion: This is a business outside my circle with negative owner earnings, no margin of safety and questionable durability. My answer is a clear \u201cno.\u201d",
