  "reasoning": "First things first, I have to admit that semiconductors lie well outside my circle of competence.  I like businesses I can wrap my arms around \u2014 simple consumer products, insurance, railroads \u2014 not rapidly shifting chip designs and cutting-edge fabs.  If I don\u2019t understand the economics, I won\u2019t invest.\n\nOn the moat front, NVIDIA shows some pricing power in its 63% operating margins, but that\u2019s about the only durable advantage I see.  Its return on equity was a tepid 5.4% last period and only once out of ten exceeded 15%.  A real economic moat should show up consistently in high, stable returns, and NVIDIA\u2019s earnings have been all over the map.\n\nManagement has been enthusiastic about issuing stock, diluting existing owners, and pays no dividend.  I prefer leaders who think like owners, conserve capital when necessary, and return cash to shareholders \u2014 Hall of Famers like Warren McLendon at Coca-Cola and Tony Nicely at GEICO.\n\nThe balance sheet isn\u2019t terrible with conservative debt, but earnings growth has been inconsistent (just 9% total over ten periods) and cash flow forecasts in your DCF actually decline in stages 1 and 2 before recovering.  That doesn\u2019t inspire confidence in long-term stability.\n\nSpeaking of valuation, your three-stage DCF pegs intrinsic value at $3,496 after a haircut.  NVIDIA currently trades far above that, implying a negative margin of safety of roughly 96%.  I\u2019d rather hold a wonderful business at a fair price than a fair business at a wonderful price, and this is neither wonderful nor fairly priced.\n\nIn the end, there are plenty of terrific businesses within my circle \u2014 Coca-Cola, Apple (as a consumer story), See\u2019s Candies \u2014 that meet every one of my criteria.  NVIDIA may be a technological marvel, but for a value-oriented, margin-of-safety investor like me, it\u2019s a pass.",
