  "reasoning": "First off, semiconductors are outside my circle of competence \u2013 it\u2019s like trying to play poker with a book of bridge hands. I\u2019ve spent my life with businesses I can understand from the ground up, and chip design with its rapid technology cycles and complexity isn\u2019t one of them.\n\nOn the moat front, the strong operating margins (~57%) hint at some pricing power, but the inconsistent ROE (only 0 out of 10 periods above 15%) and uneven earnings growth (7.9% over ten periods) tell me this advantage may not be durable. I\u2019d rather own a business like Coca-Cola or See\u2019s Candies, where the moat is plain as day.\n\nManagement seems disciplined \u2013 no significant dilution or wild acquisitions \u2013 but they pay little in dividends, and I can\u2019t gauge how they\u2019ll allocate capital over the next decade in a cut-throat industry.\n\nFinancially, conservative debt is a plus, yet a ROIC of just 2.1% and a shaky current ratio raise questions about consistency. A company with my kind of historical reliability typically puts up double-digit returns on equity year after year.\n\nValuation is the final nail in the coffin: your DCF pegs a conservative intrinsic value at $683 versus a market price implying a negative margin of safety (-92%). I\u2019d much prefer overpaying for a lovely business than jumbling my capital into a complex story at an inflated price.\n\nLong term, I worry about Moore\u2019s Law slowing, fierce competition, and rapidly evolving technology \u2013 that\u2019s a lot of red flags for a business I can\u2019t fully grasp. Compared to what\u2019s in my portfolio \u2013 simple, predictable franchises with pricing power \u2013 Nvidia just doesn\u2019t match up.\n\nWhen I don\u2019t understand something well enough to predict decades of performance, I walk away. In this case, the combination of complexity, inconsistent metrics, and lofty valuation makes it a clear no for me.",
