  "reasoning": "Well, the very first question is whether Google falls within my circle of competence. It does not. I\u2019ve steered clear of complex technology businesses for decades (with the notable Apple exception), because search algorithms and digital ad ecosystems are outside my wheelhouse. \n\nOn the moat front, Google certainly has scale advantages and network effects in search and advertising that give it a durable position. But assessing the durability of that moat\u2014given regulatory risks, competition from other platforms and changing consumer behavior\u2014requires expertise I lack.\n\nManagement at Alphabet appears competent and shareholder\u2010friendly, with a strong balance sheet and healthy cash flow. Sundar Pichai and team allocate capital to their core businesses and moonshots sensibly. But I haven\u2019t dug deeply enough into their capital\u2010allocation framework to call them world\u2010class in my terms.\n\nFinancially, Alphabet is robust, with minimal debt and consistent earnings. However, the absence of reliable intrinsic\u2010value estimates and margin\u2010of\u2010safety data here means I can\u2019t judge whether the current price offers a meaningful discount to true worth.\n\nLong\u2010term prospects are promising in cloud, AI and advertising, but there are regulatory and competitive headwinds that could erode returns. Without a clear view on intrinsic value and without that trusty margin of safety cushion, I can\u2019t commit.\n\nCompared to opportunities in my portfolio\u2014where I understand the business inside out (Coca-Cola, Apple, GEICO)\u2014Alphabet simply sits outside my expertise. As I\u2019ve said, \u2018Risk comes from not knowing what you\u2019re doing.\u2019 So my decision here is a neutral stance: I\u2019ll pass until I can truly comprehend the economics and valuation of Google in the way I require.\u201d",
