  "reasoning": "Well, I\u2019m going to start with the most important rule: stay within your circle of competence. Semiconductors are a fast\u2010moving, capital\u2010intensive business full of shifting technologies and ruthless competition. That simply isn\u2019t where I play. \n\n2. Competitive Moat: NVIDIA boasts fat operating margins and a big share of certain GPU markets, but its earnings pattern has been as up and down as a yo-yo. I look for businesses that deliver consistent returns on equity and can raise prices without losing customers. NVIDIA\u2019s ROE has only been north of 15% in zero of the last ten periods, so I\u2019m not convinced of a durable moat here. \n\n3. Management: The company has issued new shares lately, dousing shareholders with dilution rather than dividends or buybacks. I prefer managers who think like owners \u2013 reinvesting wisely or returning cash to shareholders \u2013 and I don\u2019t see that here. \n\n4. Financial Health: With an ROE of just 8.3% and debt to equity near 0.8, NVIDIA\u2019s financial fortress feels more like a sandcastle in high tide. Earnings growth has been all over the place and capital turnover is low. That\u2019s the opposite of what I seek in businesses I\u2019d hold forever. \n\n5. Valuation: At a market cap of $585 billion, the stock trades nearly a hundred percent above my conservative intrinsic value estimate of $25,200 per share (15% haircut). That leaves a whopping negative margin of safety. I\u2019d rather wait for a margin of safety than chase momentum. \n\n6. Long-Term Prospects & Red Flags: AI is all the rage, and NVIDIA sits in the sweet spot today, but tomorrow\u2019s developments or competitors could knock it off. I don\u2019t bet my shareholders\u2019 capital on perfection when I see inconsistency and fat valuations. \n\n7. Comparison to My Portfolio: I\u2019d much rather own businesses I understand thoroughly \u2013 call it Coke, See\u2019s Candies or Apple \u2013 at reasonable prices, with reliable earnings and honest management. NVIDIA doesn\u2019t fit that mold. \n\nIn short, semiconductors are outside my circle of competence, the company\u2019s moat is unproven, management dilutes equity, and the stock trades far above what I\u2019d consider intrinsic value. As I always say, \u201cIf you aren\u2019t willing to own a stock for ten years, don\u2019t even think about owning it for ten minutes.\u201d I\u2019d rather sit tight and wait than overpay here.",
