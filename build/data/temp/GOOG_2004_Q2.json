  "reasoning": "1. Circle of Competence: I\u2019ve spent my life in simple, predictable businesses\u2014consumer brands, insurance, railroads, banking. Online advertising, search algorithms and cloud computing fall outside that circle. If I don\u2019t understand the drivers of a business, I\u2019m not going to wade in, no matter how shiny the numbers look.\n\n2. Competitive Moat: On the surface, Google has the moat of a dominant search engine, tremendous network effects and vast data\u2014metrics I admire in a durable business. But the tech world evolves fast, and what looks like a moat today can evaporate tomorrow when a new competitor or regulation swings the door wide open.\n\n3. Management Quality: Sundar Pichai and Alphabet\u2019s team have navigated regulation and invested heavily in AI. I respect their capital allocation in buybacks and selective acquisitions. Still, they answer to a broad base of shareholders and must continually chase growth, not simply defend franchise profits.\n\n4. Financial Health: I\u2019m told Alphabet has a fortress balance sheet and consistent cash flow, but I\u2019ve seen no numbers here. Without reliable financials, I can\u2019t judge debt levels, return on equity or how weatherproof the earnings are in an advertising downturn.\n\n5. Valuation & Margin of Safety: With no intrinsic value estimate or margin of safety provided, I\u2019d be flying blind on price. I\u2019d rather pay a fair price for a business I fully grasp than guess at Google\u2019s future cash flows.\n\n6. Long-Term Prospects & Red Flags: Google may prosper for years, but it faces regulatory risk, rapid technological change and competition in AI, cloud and even search. That\u2019s a lot of buckets to watch, and my favorite holding period is \u2018forever\u2019\u2014not \u2018let\u2019s see what comes next quarter.\u2019\n\n7. Comparison to Current Opportunities: I\u2019d sooner put money to work in Coca-Cola, Apple\u2019s ecosystem, Bank of America or BNSF\u2014businesses I understand, with predictable economics and proven management. In Google\u2019s case, the combination of complexity, missing data and uncertain valuation means I\u2019ll sit this one out.",
