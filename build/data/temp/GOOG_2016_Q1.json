  "reasoning": "First off, I have to admit Alphabet\u2019s Google business sits outside my circle of competence.  I\u2019m a simple fellow who looks at Coca-Cola bottles, insurance policies and rail cars, not complex ad auctions and data-mining platforms.  Without reliable fundamentals or financials in front of me, I can\u2019t say I really understand the revenue mechanics or growth drivers well enough to bet a lot.  \n\nAs for a moat, Google certainly has scale, network effects and strong brand recognition in search and advertising.  But handling that moat requires staying ahead of rapid technological change and regulatory scrutiny\u2014areas I tend to avoid.  Management\u2019s track record under Sundar Pichai seems competent and focused on capital allocation, but I haven\u2019t seen enough on how they\u2019ll deploy cash for long-term shareholder value.  \n\nFinancial health is reputedly solid\u2014large cash balances, low debt\u2014but the data provided here says \u2018insufficient.\u2019  Without consistent earnings history and balance-sheet detail, I can\u2019t judge how robust their franchise really is.  \n\nValuation?  No reliable intrinsic value estimate to work with, so margin of safety is zero.  I\u2019d rather buy a wonderful business at a fair price than any business at an attractive price, and right now I don\u2019t know which bucket Google falls into.  \n\nLong-term prospects could be excellent, but the lack of clarity and rapid innovation cycles are red flags for me.  Compared to opportunities in my portfolio\u2014Apple with its consumer ecosystem, Coca-Cola\u2019s brand, BNSF\u2019s rails\u2014Google doesn\u2019t look like something I can confidently hold \u2018forever.\u2019  \n\nIn my world, when in doubt the answer is usually no.  So I\u2019ll sit this one out\u2014neutral on GOOG until I can dive deeper or understand the business on a simpler footing.",
