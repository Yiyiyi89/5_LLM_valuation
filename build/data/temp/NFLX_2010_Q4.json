  "reasoning": "First things first, Netflix doesn\u2019t fall within my circle of competence.  I gowned up investing in simple businesses I could understand \u2014 Coca-Cola, See\u2019s Candies, GEICO \u2014 not high-flying streaming services dependent on ever-rising content spend and shifting technology platforms.  If I don\u2019t understand the business model or industry dynamics, that in itself is a red flag.\n\nOn the moat question, Netflix shows pockets of pricing power and strong operating margins (36%), but that\u2019s about it.  A true moat requires a durable, sustainable competitive edge \u2014 and with Disney+, Amazon, HBO Max, Apple TV+ and the rest nipping at its heels, Netflix\u2019s content library alone won\u2019t keep the barbarians at bay.\n\nManagement has been aggressive in pursuing growth\u2014borrowing heavily (debt-to-equity north of 2.3) and issuing stock, diluting shareholders.  They\u2019ve built an impressive subscriber machine, but there\u2019s no dividend, little free cash flow synergy for shareholders, and capital allocation seems bent on growth at any cost rather than return on invested capital.\n\nWhile Netflix can boast a 16% ROE and robust operating margins, its earnings growth has been fitful and inconsistent.  A fortress balance sheet is more than a catchy phrase \u2014 it means low leverage and dependable cash generation.  Here, Netflix fails the test.\n\nPerhaps most important, the shares trade well above our conservative intrinsic value of about $435, implying nearly a 95% negative margin of safety.  In my book, paying up for optimism is a recipe for permanent capital loss.\n\nLong term, I\u2019m skeptical of the economics in streaming.  Content costs balloon, subscriber growth eventually plateaus, and stiff competition will erode pricing power.  I\u2019d rather own a wonderful business at a fair price than a fair business at a wonderful price.\n\nIn today\u2019s market, I see more attractive opportunities \u2014 established consumer staples, quality banks, and industrials with simple, durable moats \u2014 than a highly leveraged, overvalued streaming service.  My vote: no.",
