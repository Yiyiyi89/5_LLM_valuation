  "reasoning": "First off, Amazon doesn\u2019t fall inside my circle of competence. I\u2019ve spent my life studying simple businesses that produce tangible goods and services \u2013 think See\u2019s Candies, Coca-Cola or Apple\u2019s consumer ecosystem \u2013 not sprawling e-commerce marketplaces and capital-intensive cloud platforms. While Amazon has built a strong brand and network effects around Prime and AWS, its ROE has been negative over the past year and uneven across cycles, so I can\u2019t point to a durable, predictable moat the way I can with a business like Coca-Cola\u2019s beverage franchise. Management earned my respect by reinvesting heavily in growth, but I prefer executives who allocate capital conservatively and reward shareholders with dividends or buybacks once the reinvestment opportunities reach diminishing returns. Amazon\u2019s free cash flow hasn\u2019t been consistent enough, and the company still plows almost everything back into capex, leaving little clarity on long-term capital discipline. From a financial health standpoint, upside from AWS margins is attractive, but overall earnings and ROE remain choppy, and there\u2019s no margin of safety here. At roughly a $1.65 trillion market cap versus an intrinsic value near $142 per share, you\u2019re effectively paying about double what I\u2019d consider fair. I\u2019d rather own wonderful businesses in my wheelhouse trading at sensible prices than a complex, opaque business at an elevated valuation. In comparison to opportunities in my portfolio \u2013 like Coca-Cola\u2019s reliable pricing power or Apple\u2019s sticky ecosystem \u2013 Amazon doesn\u2019t meet my criteria on simplicity, consistency or price. So my answer here is a hard \u201cno.\u201d",
