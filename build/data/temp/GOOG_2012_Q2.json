  "reasoning": "I\u2019m going to start with the circle of competence, because that\u2019s Step One in my playbook. Advertising technology, search algorithms and all the machine\u2010learning wizardry that underlies Alphabet\u2019s business is far outside the bakery, soft drink and simple franchise businesses I\u2019ve spent a lifetime understanding. When I can\u2019t explain a business in plain English, I don\u2019t own it. \n\nOn the moat front, Google clearly has scale advantages and entrenched market share in search and digital advertising. Those traits might qualify as a moat for a tech investor, but I\u2019m not comfortable measuring it against a consumer staples moat like Coke\u2019s brand power or See\u2019s Candies\u2019 local pricing flexibility. \n\nI\u2019ve got zero insight into management here \u2013 the existing data says \"insufficient\" \u2013 and I need to believe management acts like owners before I bet alongside them. \n\nWith no financials or consistency history in the report, I can\u2019t assess the balance sheet or earnings durability. A fortress balance sheet matters to me, and absent any figures, I\u2019m left guessing. \n\nValuation? No intrinsic\u2010value estimate. No margin of safety. Price without value is speculation, and Berkshire doesn\u2019t dabble in speculation. \n\nLong\u2010term prospects for online advertising might be strong, but rapid technological change and regulatory risk keep me uneasy. \n\nCompared to what I own \u2013 Apple for its consumer ecosystem, Coca-Cola for decades of consistent returns, BNSF for simple infrastructure \u2013 Alphabet doesn\u2019t fit. When I don\u2019t understand, I say \u201cno.\u201d In this case, I\u2019ll simply stay on the sidelines with a neutral signal until I or my team can truly wrap our heads around the business and its financials.",
