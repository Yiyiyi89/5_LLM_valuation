  "reasoning": "Well, first off, I\u2019ve got to be honest: internet search and advertising platforms sit outside my circle of competence. As I\u2019ve often said, \u201cRisk comes from not knowing what you\u2019re doing,\u201d and I\u2019d be stretching to claim deep understanding of Google\u2019s complex algorithms, AI research and regulatory challenges. \n\nOn the moat front, Alphabet does have real advantages\u2014massive scale, network effects from search and YouTube, a mountain of user data and a brand name as well known as Coca-Cola\u2019s. That\u2019s the kind of durable franchise we like. But I\u2019d also note that moats can erode under regulatory pressure or disruptive technology\u2014risks I can\u2019t fully quantify here.\n\nManagement under Sundar Pichai deserves credit for smart long-term investments in AI, cloud infrastructure and cash returns via buybacks. Still, I haven\u2019t sat across the table with them or studied their capital-allocation decisions in fine detail, so I can\u2019t give a full Buffett stamp of approval.\n\nFinancially, I know Alphabet sits on a fortress balance sheet\u2014billions in cash, minimal long-term debt and consistent free cash flow. Yet without reliable data on margin of safety or intrinsic value calculations, I can\u2019t say whether you\u2019re paying a fair price or overpaying for tomorrow\u2019s growth.\n\nLong term, the company\u2019s position in digital advertising and AI research could be as durable as any business I\u2019ve owned. But regulatory headwinds in Europe, antitrust inquiries in Washington and the constant threat of some new technology mean there are red flags I\u2019m not comfortable ignoring.\n\nCompared to holdings like Apple\u2014where I\u2019m buying a consumer ecosystem I understand\u2014or Coca-Cola\u2014where I can forecast profits from one year to the next\u2014GOOG feels like a leap of faith. And when I can\u2019t estimate intrinsic value with confidence, I\u2019d rather sit on my hands. There\u2019s no penalty for passing on a deal that looks attractive at first glance. So for now, I\u2019ll remain neutral on this one.",
