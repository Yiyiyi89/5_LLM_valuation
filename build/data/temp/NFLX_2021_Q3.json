  "reasoning": "First off, I don\u2019t see Netflix as part of my circle of competence. I\u2019m not comfortable with the complexities of streaming technology, content licensing and production, and the competitive dynamics of digital platforms \u2013 it\u2019s not a Coca-Cola or See\u2019s Candies, and I\u2019m not about to pretend otherwise. On the moat front, Netflix has built a strong brand and some switching costs, but inconsistent ROE (only 0 out of 10 years above 15%) and no reliable pricing power analysis suggest its advantage isn\u2019t durable like a railroad or a utility. Management has been aggressive about growth with common stock dilution and zero dividends; that\u2019s not quite the owner-friendly capital allocation I admire. Financially, debt-to-equity is 1.8, ROIC is under 4%, and earnings growth has been erratic \u2013 a far cry from the fortress balance sheet I prefer. Valuation is another problem: a three-stage DCF pegs intrinsic value around $18,600 million, yet the market cap is $246,946 million, implying a negative margin of safety of nearly 92%. I\u2019d rather hold pieces of companies like Coca-Cola, Apple or our railroad at fair prices than pay up for a business I don\u2019t fully grasp and that trades well above its true worth. Long term, streaming will likely remain competitive and capital-intensive, so I\u2019ll pass. Compared to our existing holdings, Netflix simply doesn\u2019t measure up on simplicity, financial strength, or valuation \u2013 it\u2019s a no for me.",
