  "reasoning": "First things first, electric\u2010vehicle manufacturing lies well outside my circle of competence. I\u2019ve stuck to businesses I can wrap my head around\u2014think Coca-Cola or See\u2019s Candies\u2014rather than a highly cyclical, capital\u2010intensive car business dependent on rapid technological change. Tesla\u2019s core operation feels more like an index of moonshot bets than the simple, enduring franchises I understand.\n\nOn the moat front, Tesla has a strong brand and some network effects from its Supercharger network, but that isn\u2019t the sort of durable economic moat I prize. Its inconsistent ROE\u2014negative in 10 out of 10 periods\u2014and erratic earnings growth leave me unconvinced it can fend off traditional automakers and well-heeled upstarts once they master EV technology.\n\nManagement shines when it comes to hype and vision, but I need more evidence of sensible capital allocation. Tesla\u2019s debt-to-equity north of 4.0 and steadily negative owner earnings tell me they\u2019re pouring cash into a money pit rather than generating real returns. I\u2019ve seen founders that could cook the books with optimism; I prefer the plain honesty of Berkshire\u2019s insurers.\n\nFinancially, Tesla is a house of cards. Weak ROE of \u201312%, no consistent earnings growth, and owner earnings that remain in the red make it a risky wager. My mantra is \u2018\u2018wide moat, predictable earnings, strong balance sheet.\u2019\u2019 TSLA checks none of those boxes.\n\nValuation offers no relief. The three-stage DCF spits out a negative intrinsic value\u2014meaning you\u2019re paying for nothing but hope. A margin of safety in this scenario is non-existent.\n\nLong term, I admire the zeal for green transportation, but I\u2019d rather own a wonderful business at a fair price than a fair business at a wonderful price. Tesla fails both tests. Compared to the likes of Coca-Cola or BNSF Railway\u2014where earnings power and pricing power are clear as day\u2014TSLA looks like a lottery ticket. When in doubt, I say \u2018\u2018no.\u2019\u2019\u2019",
