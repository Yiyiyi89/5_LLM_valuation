  "reasoning": "First, I\u2019ll level with you: semiconductors and cutting-edge AI chips are miles outside my circle of competence.  I\u2019d rather watch from the bleachers than try to call lines in a business I don\u2019t fully understand, and Nvidia is right in the heart of that tape-measuring crowd.  Second, while Nvidia boasts an eye-popping 59% operating margin and high performance stability\u2014signs of real pricing power\u2014its return on equity has only topped 15% once in ten years, and earnings growth has been inconsistent.  Third, management has been issuing stock and pays no dividends, leaving me to wonder if they\u2019re simply trying to fund ambitious R&D rather than returning cash to shareholders.  Fourth, the balance sheet is reasonably conservative on debt, but the fundamentals show negative growth assumptions for five to ten years in this three-stage DCF, which hardly inspires confidence.  Fifth, with a current market cap north of $800 billion and a calculated intrinsic value around $2,600 per share, there\u2019s no margin of safety \u2013 the stock trades at nearly double what our model would pay.  Sixth, while AI may be the next big tide, durable moats come from brands, switching costs and regulated oligopolies, not hype cycles.  Finally, compared to the consumer stalwarts and railroads I\u2019ve owned for decades, Nvidia feels like a high-wire act without a net.  I\u2019d rather stick with businesses I understand and pay a fair price than roll the dice here.",
