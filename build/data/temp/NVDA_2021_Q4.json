  "reasoning": "First off, semiconductors are outside my circle of competence.  I don\u2019t pretend to understand the rapid technological shifts, capital intensity and fierce competition in the chip business the way I understand simple consumer staples or insurance.  On the moat front, yes, NVIDIA has blistering operating margins (nearly 70%), but chips are like fashion\u2014today\u2019s hot product can become tomorrow\u2019s leftover inventory if you miss the next node.  Management has been generous with share issuance and pays no dividend, which gives me pause on capital allocation compared to the owner\u2010friendly teams at See\u2019s Candies or GEICO.  Financially, a ROE of about 11.3% and debt\u2010to\u2010equity of 0.7 raise questions, plus earnings paths have been inconsistent despite a 234% 10\u2010period jump.  Valuation is where the alarm bells ring: even a conservative DCF pegs intrinsic value around $38,000 per share equivalent, yet the market price implies a margin of safety of \u201393%.  In plain terms, I\u2019d rather own a wonderful business at a fair price than pay a premium for a complex business I can\u2019t forecast with conviction.  For these reasons, I come away bearish on NVDA and would deploy capital where I understand the moat, the management and the price I pay.",
