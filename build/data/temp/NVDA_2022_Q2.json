  "reasoning": "I\u2019d start by admitting that semiconductor design and capital-intensive chip fabs aren\u2019t in my circle of competence. I understand soft drinks, insurance, railroads and consumer brands, but I don\u2019t pretend to know whether Nvidia\u2019s next GPU architecture will win or lose. Without that foundation I\u2019d rather pass. On the moat front, Nvidia enjoys high operating margins which hint at competitive strength, but its return on equity has been uneven (only 0 of 10 periods above 15%) and earnings have actually shrunk 28.5% over the last decade. That inconsistency undercuts any claim to a durable, widening moat. Management has raised fresh shares\u2014diluting owners\u2014and paid no meaningful dividends, so capital allocation looks focused on growth at all costs rather than steady owner earnings. The balance sheet carries modest debt but ROIC has been under 2%, suggesting the business can\u2019t sustainably earn its cost of capital. According to the three-stage DCF, even a conservative IV of about $3,300 a share puts today\u2019s market price at a nearly 100% premium\u2014no margin of safety there. Long term, Nvidia\u2019s prospects are tied to shifting technology cycles and fierce competition from AMD, Intel and new entrants; that strikes me as too much risk for capital I\u2019d like to commit forever. I\u2019d much rather own a cheaper, simpler business I understand, with a proven moat and honest managers, than try to catch lightning in a bottle here.",
