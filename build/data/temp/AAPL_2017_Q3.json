  "reasoning": "First, Apple squarely falls in my circle of competence \u2013 I\u2019m not trying to pick semiconductor cycles or biotech breakthroughs; I\u2019m buying a consumer\u2010products machine with an ecosystem that\u2019s hard to leave. \n\nWhen I assess the moat, the company\u2019s near-44% operating margin and sticky supply chain speak to real advantages, but the inconsistent return on equity \u2013 zero out of ten years above 15% \u2013 and a negative earnings trend over the past decade give me pause. \n\nManagement has generally acted like owners by building a loyal customer base, yet the recent common stock issuance and minimal dividends muddy the waters of capital allocation. \n\nOn the financial health front, the fortress has cracks: a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.6, sub-7% ROE, and erratic earnings growth don\u2019t fit my ideal of rock-solid, consistent returns with minimal leverage. \n\nMost importantly, the current market price sits well above the roughly $40,994 intrinsic value per my DCF, leaving virtually no margin of safety. Paying more than twice what a business is worth is a mistake. \n\nWhile Apple\u2019s long-term prospects as a consumer ecosystem remain bright, I\u2019d rather own a wonderful business at a fair price than a frothy one. \n\nCompared to opportunities in my portfolio \u2013 Coca-Cola, BNSF or See\u2019s Candies \u2013 where pricing is reasonable and moats are rock-solid, Apple\u2019s current valuation simply doesn\u2019t measure up. It\u2019s a hard no for me at these levels.",
