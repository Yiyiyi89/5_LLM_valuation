  "reasoning": "First things first: Alphabet (GOOG) lives in an arena I don\u2019t claim to fully understand \u2013 the ad-tech world of search auctions, algorithms and regulators. That puts it outside my primary circle of competence. We\u2019d rather forgo great opportunities than risk capital in areas we can\u2019t see clearly.\n\nMoat: On paper Google\u2019s got a formidable network effect: the more people search, the more advertisers bid, and vice versa. That\u2019s a durable advantage \u2013 akin to a toll bridge that collects a fee every time a car crosses. But it isn\u2019t a moat I fully appreciate from the inside, and regulators are circling, which can erode any advantage over time.\n\nManagement: Sundar Pichai and his team have steered high returns and kept the engine humming, but we lack detailed insight into how they think about allocating excess cash. I\u2019ve seen far more transparent capital-allocators at work in businesses I understand \u2013 think See\u2019s Candies or GEICO.\n\nFinancial health: From public snippets we know Alphabet boasts a fortress-like balance sheet and consistent cash flow. That\u2019s one box checked, but it\u2019s not enough for me to leap in when I can\u2019t value the future with any degree of certainty.\n\nValuation: With \u2018insufficient data for reliable valuation,\u2019 I\u2019m flying blind. Intrinsic value is the bedrock of our process \u2013 \u201cprice is what you pay, value is what you get.\u201d Without a sound calculation, there\u2019s no margin of safety.\n\nLong-term prospects and red flags: Search and ads will likely generate cash for years, but the pace of technological change and antitrust scrutiny are tangible headwinds. I\u2019d rather sleep at night knowing I own businesses that trade less on pattern recognition and more on simple economics.\n\nRelative to what\u2019s in our barnyard today \u2013 Coca-Cola, Apple (which we view as a consumer products play), BNSF, and our insurance franchises \u2013 Google doesn\u2019t measure up in terms of clarity or comfort. In sum, it\u2019s a well-run business, but not one I\u2019d commit Berkshire capital to when I can\u2019t wrap my arms around the model or the value.\n\nSo I\u2019ll sit this one out and wait for an opportunity in my wheelhouse.",
