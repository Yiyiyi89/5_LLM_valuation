  "reasoning": "I\u2019m going to be upfront: I don\u2019t have the data I need to make a conviction either way, and Alphabet (GOOG) falls outside my usual circle of competence. 1. Circle of Competence: I\u2019ve spent my life understanding businesses like Coca-Cola, See\u2019s Candies and simple insurance operations, not complex online advertising platforms and search algorithms. If I don\u2019t understand the engine under the hood, I\u2019m better off sitting on my hands. 2. Competitive Moat: On paper Google has network effects and scale in search and digital ads, but I can\u2019t assess from zero data how sustainable that advantage will be amid regulatory pressures and fast-moving ad tech competitors. 3. Management Quality: Sundar Pichai and the team have guided Google well, yet without detailed insights I can\u2019t judge whether they\u2019ll allocate capital in shareholders\u2019 best interest over the next 20 years. 4. Financial Health and Consistency: I\u2019ve got no fundamentals to review\u2014no revenue growth rates, profit margins or debt levels\u2014so I simply can\u2019t evaluate consistency of earnings or strength of the balance sheet. 5. Valuation vs. Intrinsic Value: With no intrinsic-value model available, I can\u2019t tell if the current price leaves me a margin of safety. 6. Long-Term Prospects: The internet economy likely has legs, but the pace of change and regulatory risk is high. 7. Comparison to Current Opportunities: I\u2019d rather deploy capital into businesses with clear, proven economics and durable moats that I understand. In short, I don\u2019t know enough, so I\u2019ll pass for now and keep looking for opportunities where my edge is real.",
