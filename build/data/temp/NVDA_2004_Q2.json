  "reasoning": "First and foremost this falls well outside my circle of competence because the semiconductor industry is too complex and rapidly changing for me. The numbers show a weak ROE of just half a percent and negative owner earnings, while the three-stage DCF model spits out a negative intrinsic value and leaves us with no margin of safety. Although Nvidia has strong operating margins, I don\u2019t see a reliable moat akin to pricing power in consumer staples or network effects that stand the test of time. Management may be talented, but capital allocation in this volatile sector can be a roll of the dice. With inconsistent earnings growth and a negative long-term earnings trend, the financial fortress isn\u2019t there. The stock trades at a level that implies negative intrinsic value per share, so price is what you pay and value is what you get tells me the price is far too high. I\u2019d rather own proven businesses like Coca-Cola or Apple in my portfolio than chase a complex semiconductor story. For these reasons I am bearish on NVDA.",
