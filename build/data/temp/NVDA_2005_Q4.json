  "reasoning": "1. Circle of Competence: I don\u2019t fully understand the semiconductor game. I spent 60-plus years learning insurance, rails, consumer brands and banks. Chips change every quarter, and risk comes from not knowing what you\u2019re doing. So right off the bat, NVDA is outside my wheelhouse.\n2. Competitive Moat: Sure, Nvidia\u2019s operating margins near 40% hint at pricing power, but return on equity only 6.5% and zero out of ten periods above 15% tells me the moat may be spotty. A true moat endures for decades, like Coca-Cola\u2019s brand or See\u2019s Candies\u2019 simple economics. Nvidia\u2019s advantage could vanish with the next architecture shift.\n3. Management & Capital Allocation: I see common shares issued, minimal dividends and no reliable buybacks. That\u2019s a signal capital allocation isn\u2019t geared to reward long-term owners. I like managers who think like owners, not issuers seeking to fund growth at shareholders\u2019 expense.\n4. Financial Health & Consistency: Earnings are all over the map\u20141432% growth in ten periods but no consistency. A fortress company shows steady, predictable returns. Nvidia\u2019s ROIC of 5% and uneven earnings make me uneasy.\n5. Valuation vs. Intrinsic Value: The three-stage DCF pegs conservative intrinsic value at about $1,006. The stock trades well above that, leaving an \u201385% margin of safety. As I often say, \u2018Price is what you pay; value is what you get.\u2019 Here you\u2019re paying full price for uncertain value.\n6. Long-term Prospects & Red Flags: Semis face rapid technological change, fierce competition and capital-intensive cycles. I prefer businesses that will look familiar in 20 years\u2014Walmart, GEICO, BNSF\u2014where I know how the economics will behave.\n7. Comparison to My Portfolio: I\u2019d rather own a wonderful business\u2014think Coca-Cola or Apple\u2014at a fair price than a fair business at a wonderful price. Nvidia is neither within my circle nor priced with a margin of safety. In my yard, the grass is greener with businesses I understand.\nSo, while Nvidia may be great for specialists, for me it\u2019s a no. I\u2019ll stick to companies where I have an edge and a margin of safety.",
