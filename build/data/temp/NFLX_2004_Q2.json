  "reasoning": "1. Circle of Competence: I stick to businesses I can draw on a cocktail napkin\u2014consumer staples, insurance, rail, utilities. Streaming video is outside my wheelhouse. I don\u2019t fully understand the economics of content licensing, subscriber churn, algorithm-driven recommendations and the constant arms race for original programming.  \n2. Economic Moat: Netflix shows strong operating margins (61%), but its ROE is just 2.4% and ROIC 1.4%. High margins alone don\u2019t translate to a durable moat when every deep-pocketed competitor from Disney to Amazon is pouring billions into content. There\u2019s limited pricing power because subscribers can cancel at any moment.  \n3. Management & Capital Allocation: Management has plowed money into content, yet owner earnings are negative $18 per share. No dividends, minimal buybacks, and rising debt to equity at 0.7x. That\u2019s not the capital allocation of a business thinking like an owner.  \n4. Financial Health & Consistency: Inconsistent earnings growth, negative free cash flow and a three-stage DCF that produces a negative intrinsic value (\u2013$153 per share, margin of safety \u2013109%). That\u2019s a giant red flag.  \n5. Valuation: With a market cap north of $1.5 trillion and negative owner earnings, NFLX is trading far above any reasonable estimate of intrinsic value.  \n6. Long-Term Prospects & Red Flags: The streaming space is a treadmill of rising content costs, intense competition and fickle customers. I don\u2019t see a franchise that will prosper unchanged for decades.  \n7. Opportunity Cost: I\u2019d rather own Coca-Cola, Apple, BNSF or a conservatively run insurer\u2014wonderful businesses with durable moats at fair prices. In my view, Netflix is an overvalued, capital-hungry enterprise outside my circle, so the answer here is a firm \u201cno.\u201d",
