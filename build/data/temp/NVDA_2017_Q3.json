  "reasoning": "1. Circle of Competence: Semiconductors like NVIDIA lie outside my circle\u2014this business is driven by technical cycles, R&D pipelines, and rapid innovation. I\u2019d be speculating, not investing. 2. Moat: While NVIDIA\u2019s operating margins average over 60% hint at pricing power, its ROE has never exceeded 15% in ten years. That tells me margins are narrow, uneven, and subject to fierce competition and Moore\u2019s Law erosion. 3. Management: Recent stock issuance shows dilution, and with no dividend policy, shareholders rely entirely on capital gains. I prefer owners who return capital or reinvest for stable returns. 4. Financial Health: ROE of 13.2%, ROC of 8.5%, debt/equity of 0.5 and inconsistent earnings growth signal a cyclical, capital\u2010intensive business with patchy results. 5. Valuation: The three\u2010stage DCF pegs intrinsic value at about $11,265 per share after a 15% haircut. With NVIDIA priced well above that, margin of safety is strongly negative (\u201390%). Paying more than a business is worth is a recipe for permanent loss. 6. Long\u2010term Prospects: Technology leadership can be fleeting. What\u2019s cutting\u2010edge today may be commoditized tomorrow. I\u2019d rather own durable franchises like Coca-Cola or See\u2019s Candies, where the moat and predictability are clear. 7. Opportunity Cost: I can find consumer staples or financials in my portfolio trading at or below intrinsic value with solid dividends and rock-steady returns. In my view, NVIDIA is a fine machine\u2010learning story, but it\u2019s too complex, too volatile, and too pricey for my approach. Therefore, I\u2019ll pass.",
