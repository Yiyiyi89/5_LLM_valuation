  "reasoning": "1. Circle of Competence: I\u2019ll be candid \u2013 I don\u2019t understand NVIDIA\u2019s semiconductor ecosystem the way I know soft drinks or railroads. Chips and AI pipelines are outside my circle. As I always say, \u201cRisk comes from not knowing what you\u2019re doing.\u201d 2. Competitive Moat: While NVIDIA boasts high operating margins (around 41%), its ROE has averaged just 2.5% with zero out of ten periods above 15%. That\u2019s hardly a sign of a durable moat \u2013 it\u2019s like a castle with a drawbridge up one year and down the next. 3. Management Quality: I see recent stock issuance (dilution) and no dividend discipline. I prefer managers who think like owners \u2013 Warren Hathaway\u2019s team at Geico didn\u2019t dilute shares every time they needed capital. 4. Financial Health & Consistency: NVIDIA\u2019s earnings growth has been erratic, with a 28.8% decline over ten periods. Owner earnings are negative $92 per share. I want consistency \u2013 Coca-Cola may not be glamorous, but it prints cash year after year. 5. Valuation: A three-stage DCF spits out a negative intrinsic value (\u2013$728 per share after a haircut) and a negative margin of safety. Paying up for a business with no positive fair value is a recipe for permanent loss. 6. Long-Term Prospects & Red Flags: The AI craze may drive headlines, but cycles in semiconductors can be brutal. Inventory gluts, competition from AMD, Intel, and new entrants make this a high-stakes game. I\u2019d rather own something that will be around prospering decades from now. 7. Comparison to My Portfolio: I\u2019d much rather allocate capital to tried-and-true businesses in my circle \u2013 Coca-Cola, See\u2019s Candies, Apple\u2019s ecosystem or strong banks like Bank of America. In sum, NVIDIA is a fascinating tech story, but it fails my first test: I don\u2019t understand it, and the numbers confirm the risk. I\u2019ll pass.",
