  "reasoning": "1. Circle of Competence: I\u2019ve spent my life buying simple, enduring businesses I understand\u2014Coca-Cola, See\u2019s Candies, insurance, railroads. Alphabet is a complex technology company outside my circle. Risk comes from not knowing what you\u2019re doing, and I simply don\u2019t know enough about its ad auction algorithms, AI roadmap or regulatory exposures to invest.\n\n2. Moat Assessment: Google arguably has a strong advertising franchise, search dominance and data advantages\u2014potential moats. But I can\u2019t verify pricing power or network effects here because the data is missing.\n\n3. Management Quality: Sundar Pichai and the Alphabet team have delivered profits and reinvested in moonshots. They seem honest and competent\u2014but with no analysis details, I can\u2019t judge owner-like capital allocation.\n\n4. Financial Health & Consistency: We have no reliable revenue, profit, debt or cash flow figures. I look for 20+ years of consistent earnings\u2014this is absent.\n\n5. Valuation & Intrinsic Value: Without cash flow forecasts or intrinsic value estimates, there\u2019s no margin of safety. I\u2019d rather buy a wonderful business at a fair price than a fair business at a wonderful price.\n\n6. Long-Term Prospects & Red Flags: Tech evolves rapidly\u2014platforms can be disrupted, regulation may bite. Though Google looks solid today, I worry about antitrust, privacy laws and competition. \n\n7. Comparison to Portfolio: I\u2019d rather own Berkshire\u2019s existing holdings in consumer staples, insurance and our Apple position where I understand the economics. When in doubt, the answer is usually \u201cno.\u201d\n\nConclusion: Alphabet is outside my circle, lacks sufficient data for true Buffett analysis, and carries tech-industry risks I can\u2019t assess. I\u2019d pass.",
