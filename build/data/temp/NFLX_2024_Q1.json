  "reasoning": "1. Circle of Competence: I\u2019d rather stick to things I know\u2014consumer staples, insurance, banks, railroads and simple industrials. Streaming video is outside my circle of competence. I don\u2019t fully understand the content wars, shifting technology platforms and global licensing agreements well enough to bet billions.\n2. Economic Moat: NFLX shows strong operating margins around 48%, but its moat is flimsy. Content libraries and brand recognition matter, yet competitors with deep pockets (Disney, Amazon, HBO) can undercut prices or produce more content. High churn risk and rising programming costs weigh on durability.\n3. Management & Capital Allocation: The company has raised equity repeatedly and carries a debt\u2010to\u2010equity over 1.3, diluting shareholders and adding financial risk. No dividends or buybacks, just more spending on content\u2014hardly the owner\u2010oriented stewardship I admire at See\u2019s Candies or Coca-Cola.\n4. Financial Health & Consistency: ROE is just 10.9%, ROIC 4.8%, and earnings growth has been lumpy\u2014zero out of ten periods above 15% ROE. For a durable business, I want consistent earnings, not roller-coaster results.\n5. Valuation & Margin of Safety: At a negative margin of safety (~\u201384%), NFLX trades well above the conservative intrinsic value of ~$35,700 (per the three\u2010stage DCF). Price here vastly exceeds what I\u2019d consider fair, and I\u2019m not keen on paying up for uncertain growth.\n6. Long\u2010Term Prospects & Red Flags: The streaming industry is dynamic and competitive. Content costs keep spiraling, and subscription growth may flatten in mature markets. There\u2019s no reliable pricing power\u2014consumers can jump to a cheaper service or pirate content.\n7. Relative Opportunity: Given my portfolio of wide-moat consumer brands, insurance float generators and utilities that raise prices over time, Netflix doesn\u2019t measure up. I\u2019d rather hold a wonderful business at a fair price than a fair business at a wonderful price.\nConclusion: Outside my circle, with shaky moat, uneven results and no margin of safety\u2014I\u2019ll pass on NFLX.",
