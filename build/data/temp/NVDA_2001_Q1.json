  "reasoning": "1. Circle of Competence: Semiconductors and AI chips aren\u2019t in my wheelhouse. As I\u2019ve often said, \u201cRisk comes from not knowing what you\u2019re doing,\u201d and I don\u2019t fully grasp the cyclical nature and rapid innovation of the chip business. 2. Moat: NVIDIA may have short-term advantages in AI workloads, but I see no enduring economic moat\u2014competitors like AMD, Intel and TSMC are nipping at its heels, and technology evolves too quickly to guarantee pricing power. 3. Management: There\u2019s no history of consistent, shareholder-friendly capital allocation\u2014no dividends and only neutral share issuance\u2014whereas I prefer teams that run a business as if it\u2019s their own. 4. Financial Health: A 5.8% ROE and 1.3 debt-to-equity are red flags; earnings are inconsistent despite high operating margins, and a volatile cycle can wipe out book gains. 5. Valuation: My DCF pegs intrinsic value at about $72 versus today\u2019s price north of $140\u2014a negative margin of safety of nearly 100%. As I say, \u201cPrice is what you pay; value is what you get,\u201d and right now you\u2019re paying far more than the business is worth. 6. Long-term Prospects: AI is exciting, but I\u2019d rather own a business with decades of stable cash flows and simple economics. 7. Portfolio Comparison: Given better opportunities in staples like Coca-Cola, Apple and well-run banks at more attractive valuations, NVDA fails the five tests of my decision hierarchy. In short, it\u2019s outside my circle, overvalued and too risky for my taste.",
