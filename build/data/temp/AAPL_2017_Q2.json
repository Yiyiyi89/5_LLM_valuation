  "reasoning": "First things first: Apple sits inside my circle of competence because I view it as a consumer products company with an ecosystem that keeps folks loyal. But knowing a business and paying too much for it are two different things. \n\nOn the moat, Apple\u2019s operating margins of roughly 43% hint at pricing power and a loyal customer base, but the inconsistent ROE (0 of 10 years above 15%) and flat earnings growth (\u201338.8% over ten periods) suggest that the cushion around that moat isn\u2019t as wide or steady as I\u2019d like. In my experience, Coca-Cola and See\u2019s Candies deliver repeatable, rising returns on capital \u2013 Apple\u2019s hasn\u2019t shown that dependability in this data set. \n\nManagement\u2019s record here raises a few eyebrows: recent stock issuance and minimal dividends tell me they\u2019re not as disciplined with share count or free cash flow distribution as I\u2019d wish. I look for executives who think like owners, shrinking share count and returning cash when appropriate. \n\nFinancially, you\u2019ve got strong operating margins but a weak ROE (8.2%), low ROIC (3.3%), and a hefty debt/equity of 1.5. When Bob and I bought GEICO, we saw fortress-like balance sheets. This feels more leveraged and less consistent. \n\nYou\u2019ve run a three-stage DCF that pegs conservative intrinsic value at about $81,400 per share versus a market value that delivers a negative margin of safety (\u201388%). I\u2019d need a substantial discount to intrinsic value before writing a check, and that\u2019s simply not present here. \n\nLong term, I still admire Apple\u2019s ecosystem and brand. But right now the stock is priced beyond what I calculate as a fair value, and I\u2019d rather sit on my cash than overpay for growth that hasn\u2019t shown up reliably in the numbers. Comparatively, if I can buy Coca-Cola or American Express at a reasonable price, I\u2019ll pick them every time. \n\nIn short: great business, wrong price \u2013 I\u2019ll wait for a better entry point.",
