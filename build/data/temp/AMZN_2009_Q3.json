  "reasoning": "First off, Amazon isn\u2019t really in my circle of competence.  I\u2019m comfortable with simple retail and consumer staples, but when a company is half\u2010commerce, half\u2010cloud computing, advertising and logistics all rolled into one, I run the other way.  My rule is: if I don\u2019t understand the business, I won\u2019t invest.  \n\nAs for the moat, Amazon certainly has scale and network effects in e-commerce and AWS, which show up in those solid operating margins near 25%.  But its returns on equity have only topped 15% in one out of the last ten years, and its return on invested capital is barely above 2%.  That tells me the competitive advantages aren\u2019t durable enough to earn the kind of returns I look for.  \n\nOn management, I\u2019ll give Jeff Bezos credit for building one of the biggest businesses on earth, but capital has been plowed back into growth rather than into high-return projects or shareholder distributions.  We\u2019ve seen little in the way of dividends and only modest buybacks, so there\u2019s no proof of disciplined capital allocation in my book.  \n\nFinancially, the debt\u2010to\u2010equity ratio of 1.5 and a weak ROE around 5.6% ring warning bells.  Inconsistent earnings growth and a zero score on consistency analysis compound my concerns.  Even with great top\u2010line expansion, if you can\u2019t convert capital into high returns, you\u2019re not in my wheelhouse.  \n\nValuation is the final nail in the coffin.  Your DCF pegs intrinsic value around $1,446 a share, yet the stock trades well above that\u2014leaving a negative margin of safety of roughly 96%.  I\u2019d rather follow my own dictum: \"Price is what you pay, value is what you get.\"  Here, you\u2019re paying much more than value.  \n\nLong term, e-commerce and cloud may grow, but competition intensifies every day\u2014from Walmart online to Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud.  With low returns on capital, high reinvestment needs, and no margin of safety, I see more risk than reward.  \n\nCompared to the likes of Coca-Cola, Apple (in my view, a consumer products play), or our banks and insurance businesses, Amazon simply doesn\u2019t offer the predictable, high-return franchise at an attractive price.  My favorite holding period is forever, but you need a durable moat, honest managers allocating capital wisely, and a bargain price.  Amazon checks none of those boxes for me today.  So the answer is no.",
