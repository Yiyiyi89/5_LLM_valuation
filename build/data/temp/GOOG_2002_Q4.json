  "reasoning": "First things first, I need to determine if I understand Google\u2019s business well enough to invest. Internet search, online advertising and rapidly evolving technology simply lie outside my circle of competence. I\u2019ve spent 60-plus years sticking to businesses I can see, touch or otherwise fully grasp \u2013 think Coke, See\u2019s Candies, Apple\u2019s consumer ecosystem or simple utilities and railroads.   \n\nOn the moat front, Google undoubtedly benefits from scale, network effects and strong brand recognition. But without reliable data on revenue trends, margins, R&D investment and competitive pressures, I can\u2019t judge whether its advantages will hold for the next 20 years.   \n\nRegarding management, I\u2019ve long admired Larry Page and Sergey Brin\u2019s vision and Sundar Pichai\u2019s stewardship; Alphabet has generated healthy free cash flow and returned capital via buybacks. But I have no hard numbers here to assess capital allocation metrics or board alignment with shareholders.   \n\nFinancially, the absence of balance-sheet details, debt levels or consistent earnings data means I can\u2019t confirm a \u2018financial fortress\u2019 \u2013 one of my key criteria.   \n\nIntrinsic value? With no reliable estimates of future cash flows, discount rates or growth assumptions, any valuation would be a guess. And a guess on price versus value is something I try to avoid.   \n\nLong term, the prospects for artificial intelligence, cloud computing and digital ads are intriguing, but rapid change and fierce competition (from the likes of Amazon, Microsoft and emerging AI upstarts) raise red flags for someone who prefers predictability.   \n\nCompared to opportunities in my existing portfolio \u2013 a consumer\u2010staples giant like Coca-Cola, a stable insurer like GEICO or Apple\u2019s sticky ecosystem \u2013 I\u2019d rather sit on my hands than dive into Google without deeper understanding. \n\nIn short, I\u2019m going to pass. When I lack competence or data, the right answer for Berkshire is usually \u2018no.\u2019 There\u2019s no penalty for being patient.",
