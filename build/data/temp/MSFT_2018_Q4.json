  "reasoning": "First off, Microsoft isn\u2019t in my Circle of Competence. I\u2019ve built my record on straightforward businesses \u2013 Coke, See\u2019s Candies, insurance \u2013 not sprawling software platforms and cloud services. While Microsoft\u2019s operating margins are impressive, the inconsistency in returns (only 1 of 10 years above 15% ROE) and a chunky debt\u2010to\u2010equity of 2.1 raise flags about financial fortress strength and earnings consistency.\n\nOn the moat, I\u2019ll admit their stable 73% operating margins hint at pricing power, but inconsistent ROEs and choppy earnings growth undercut what I\u2019d call a truly durable advantage. As for management, issuing stock and paying no meaningful dividends \u2013 according to the data \u2013 suggests capital allocation that favors expansion over returning cash to owners. That\u2019s fine in growth businesses, but it\u2019s not my style unless there\u2019s a huge margin of safety.\n\nSpeaking of valuation, the three\u2010stage DCF pegs intrinsic value around $42,000 after a conservative haircut, yet the current price implies a negative 94% margin of safety. I\u2019d rather own a wonderful business at a fair price than a fair business at a wonderful price. Microsoft today looks expensive for the uncertainties in growth and returns.\n\nLong term, software will matter, but I\u2019m uncomfortable forecasting cloud and AI economics over decades. Compare this to Coca-Cola\u2019s brand moat or our insurance float at GEICO \u2013 those are businesses I not only understand but can value with confidence. In short, I\u2019ll pass on Microsoft and wait for a simpler business with a real margin of safety.",
