  "reasoning": "1. Circle of Competence: Streaming media isn\u2019t fish I know how to catch. I\u2019ve built my success on simple, predictable businesses\u2014candy stores, railroads, consumer staples\u2014not on content budgets and subscriber churn in a cutthroat tech world. \n\n2. Economic Moat: Netflix shows some pricing power in mature markets, but content is easily replicated, competition is fierce (Disney+, Amazon, HBO), and its ROE only tops 15% in 4 of 10 periods. A moat this leaky won\u2019t stand for decades. \n\n3. Management & Capital Allocation: Reed Hastings and team have grown subscriber counts, but at the cost of piling up debt (4.4\u00d7 equity). No dividends, minimal buybacks. I prefer managers who act like owners\u2014returning cash when businesses are strong, not simply raising their content budget. \n\n4. Financial Health & Consistency: A 0.3% ROE and \u221294% earnings growth over 10 periods scream instability. Yes, operating margins near 29% look healthy\u2014akin to narrowing down the herd\u2014but the debt load and erratic earnings leave little margin for error. \n\n5. Valuation & Margin of Safety: Your DCF pegs intrinsic value around $31; at today\u2019s price Netflix offers essentially no margin of safety. \u201cPrice is what you pay, value is what you get,\u201d and here I\u2019m paying more than I believe the business is worth. \n\n6. Long-Term Prospects & Red Flags: The streaming arena demands relentless content spending, and consumer tastes shift like desert sands. I\u2019d rather bet my chips on a business with predictable cash flows and durable moats. \n\n7. Opportunity Comparison: I\u2019d place my capital in Coca-Cola\u2019s ubiquitous brand or Apple\u2019s sticky ecosystem before touching this. Netflix falls outside my wheelhouse, carries too much debt, and offers too little margin for safety. In my book, when in doubt, the answer is usually \u201cno.\u201d",
