  "reasoning": "Well, the first thing I look at is my circle of competence. I\u2019ve spent my life buying simple, predictable businesses\u2014insurance, consumer products, railroads, banks. Google is an advertising\u2010driven technology company with a sprawling mix of search, cloud, YouTube and AI bets. I don\u2019t fully understand all the moving parts or regulatory risks in that business, so right off the bat I\u2019m out of my comfort zone.  \n\nSecond, the moat. Google certainly has brand recognition and network effects from its search engine and user data, but with no detailed data here I can\u2019t gauge durability\u2014monopolies attract regulators and competitors.  \n\nThird, management quality. I\u2019ve seen that Alphabet\u2019s leadership has allocated capital into projects like Waymo and various moonshots. Without stronger proof of disciplined capital allocation and shareholder\u2010friendly behavior I can\u2019t weigh in.  \n\nFourth, financial health. There\u2019s no balance-sheet or earnings data provided, so I can\u2019t tell if there\u2019s consistent free cash flow or a fortress balance sheet.  \n\nFifth, valuation. With no intrinsic value estimate or margin of safety calculated, I have no idea if the stock trades at half its worth or twice its worth.  \n\nSixth, long-term prospects. Search and digital ads could persist for decades, but technology and regulation move quickly. That uncertainty is not what I look for in a forever holding.  \n\nFinally, compared to opportunities I know\u2014Coca-Cola\u2019s brand, Apple\u2019s ecosystem, BNSF\u2019s network\u2014Google doesn\u2019t fit my recipe. There\u2019s no penalty for passing on an idea I don\u2019t understand. So I\u2019ll pass, staying neutral until something changes.",
