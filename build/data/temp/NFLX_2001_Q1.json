  "reasoning": "First and foremost, I have to say that streaming media\u2014Netflix in particular\u2014lies well outside my circle of competence. As I\u2019ve often noted, \u201cRisk comes from not knowing what you\u2019re doing,\u201d and I simply don\u2019t claim to understand the economics of content studios, subscriber algorithms and the cutthroat world of Hollywood. Without reliable fundamentals, moat analysis, management track record or intrinsic value estimates, I can\u2019t tell whether Netflix has a durable competitive advantage or is merely chasing market share with ever-increasing content spend. \n\nFrom what little we know, Netflix faces an uphill battle maintaining pricing power against a flood of competitors. Its content library is expensive to build and easy to replicate; there\u2019s no meaningful switching cost that would keep me confident of long-term subscriber retention. We have zero insight here into balance sheet strength or consistent earnings\u2014just \u201cinsufficient data\u201d across the board\u2014which raises a big red flag for me on financial health. \n\nManagement may be talented at building subscriber counts, but we have no visibility into their capital allocation or stewardship of shareholder capital. With no credible valuation or margin of safety, there\u2019s simply no way to determine an intrinsic value, so I\u2019d be guessing at the price I\u2019m paying. \n\nWhen I compare this to holding stakes in businesses like Coca-Cola, Apple or GEICO\u2014where I understand the business, see durable moats and sensible management\u2014I\u2019d rather own a wonderful business at a fair price than a fair business at a wonderful price. In this case, Netflix doesn\u2019t clear those hurdles for me, so my signal is bearish. Investing without a margin of safety is a recipe for permanent loss, and I\u2019d rather sit on the sidelines.",
