  "reasoning": "I\u2019d pass on Netflix. First off, it isn\u2019t in my circle of competence\u2014streaming media feels more like high-tech gambling than the simple, predictable consumer businesses I understand. On durability, Netflix shows only a modest moat: operating margins are strong at 38%, but inconsistent ROE (just 6.3%) and churn in earnings growth suggest competitors can bite into its lead. Management has been aggressive with debt and dilution\u2014issuing stock and carrying a debt-to-equity near 0.8 without paying dividends\u2014which tells me capital allocation isn\u2019t quite conservative. The balance sheet is stretched, owner earnings are negative, and earnings consistency is weak (0/10 periods ROE over 15%, earnings growth choppy). Valuation is absurd: our three-stage DCF spits out a negative intrinsic value (about \u2013$24 per share conservatively), so the market is pricing in perfection, not reality. In contrast, I\u2019d rather own durable brands like Coca-Cola or Apple (where there\u2019s a real moat and fortress balance sheet) at fair valuations. Netflix has uncertain long-term economics, heavy content costs, and fierce competition. No margin of safety here\u2014I\u2019ll say no.",
