  "reasoning": "1. Circle of Competence: I\u2019m not invested in businesses I don\u2019t understand, and streaming media is far afield from simple consumer staples, insurance or utilities. As I\u2019ve often said, \u201cRisk comes from not knowing what you\u2019re doing.\u201d NFLX falls outside my circle of competence.  \n\n2. Competitive Moat: While Netflix enjoys strong operating margins (averaging 32%) that hint at some pricing power, its inconsistent ROE (only 0 out of 10 periods above 15%) and negative owner earnings suggest the moat is neither durable nor economic. Good businesses show persistent returns on capital.  \n\n3. Management & Capital Allocation: Management pours cash into content creation but generates negative owner earnings (\u2013$11/share) and hasn\u2019t paid dividends or meaningfully reduced debt. That raises questions whether shareholders are being treated like owners.  \n\n4. Financial Health & Consistency: With a debt-to-equity ratio of 3.6, weak ROE at 1.4%, negative free cash flow trends and zero earnings growth over ten periods, NFLX resembles a growth story burning cash rather than a fortress of financial strength.  \n\n5. Valuation vs. Intrinsic Value: A three-stage DCF spits out a negative intrinsic value (~\u2013$90/share even after a 15% haircut) and a margin of safety of \u2013100%, clearly indicating you\u2019re paying far more than the business is worth.  \n\n6. Long-Term Prospects & Red Flags: The streaming space faces fierce competition, rising content costs and shrinking margins as global growth slows. Those are serious headwinds for an already cash-hungry model.  \n\n7. Comparison to Portfolio Opportunities: I\u2019d rather own a wonderful business\u2014like Coca-Cola or Apple\u2014with durable brand moats, strong free cash flow and sensible capital allocation, even at a fair price, than a speculative growth story with poor fundamentals.  \n\nConclusion: Netflix trades outside my circle of competence, lacks a reliable moat, generates negative owner earnings under a heavy debt load and demands a price far above any reasonable intrinsic value. I\u2019m firmly bearish on NFLX with high conviction.",
