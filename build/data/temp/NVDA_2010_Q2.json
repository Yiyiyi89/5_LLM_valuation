  "reasoning": "Well, I\u2019ll be honest\u2014I don\u2019t invest in semiconductors. It\u2019s outside my circle of competence. I understand soft drinks, insurance and railroads; I don\u2019t pretend to grasp the twists and turns of chip design and AI acceleration. That alone rules it out.\n\nAs for a moat, Nvidia certainly earns hefty operating margins today, but its ROE has been negative in recent years and earnings are wildly inconsistent. A real moat shows up in durable profits year after year\u2014See\u2019s Candies and Coca-Cola delivered that, Nvidia has not.\n\nManagement hasn\u2019t paid dividends or shown a pattern of disciplined capital allocation. When you\u2019re running a business that loses money and changing capital requirements every quarter, you can\u2019t judge stewardship by a couple of data points.\n\nThe balance sheet looks okay on debt, but negative owner earnings and unpredictable returns on capital are red flags. Buffett likes lumpy industries that promise steady free cash flow, not wild oscillations.\n\nOn valuation, the three-stage DCF spits out a negative intrinsic value and a negative margin of safety. You can\u2019t pay a high multiple for uncertainty and expect to come out ahead.\n\nI prefer wonderful businesses selling for fair prices over fair businesses at wonderful prices. Nvidia may be exciting, but it fails every step of my checklist. My capital would be better employed buying more Coca-Cola or adding to Apple, where I can sleep at night. So this one\u2019s a no \u2013 I\u2019m bearish.",
