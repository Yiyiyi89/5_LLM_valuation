  "reasoning": "I\u2019ll start right off: Tesla is outside my circle of competence. I built my record by sticking to businesses I understand\u2014insurance, consumer brands, railroads\u2014where I can see a durable moat and predictable earnings. An electric\u2010car manufacturer with massive capital requirements, razor\u2010thin margins, and wild swings in profitability just doesn\u2019t fit.\n\nOn moat, I don\u2019t see a durable advantage. Cars are commodity products with intense competition from legacy automakers and upstarts alike. Brand enthusiasm and a fancy charging network give Tesla a short\u2010term edge, but I\u2019d need to be convinced that it can fend off Mercedes, Toyota, VW, Ford, and a host of Chinese competitors over the next 20 years. That\u2019s a tall order in a business with low switching costs for fleet operators and consumers when similar or cheaper EVs flood the market.\n\nManagement is led by Mr. Musk\u2014a visionary for sure\u2014but I can\u2019t assess how shareholder\u2010friendly capital allocation will be over decades. Between massive factory builds, debt raises, and investments in speculative ventures like humanoid robots and space travel, I see more risk of wasted capital than compounding cash. A first\u2010rate manager thinking like an owner wouldn\u2019t juggle so many disparate ambitions.\n\nOn the balance sheet, Tesla swings from red ink to narrow profits and often funds growth with debt or equity. I like companies that generate consistent free cash flow and carry little leverage. Tesla\u2019s high fixed costs, cyclical auto demand, and capital intensity make that unlikely in my view.\n\nValuation? Without reliable intrinsic\u2010value metrics, we\u2019re flying blind. The stock trades at multiples that imply perfection\u2014year after year of breakneck growth with no margin slip or competitive inroads by others. I\u2019ve said we pay all year for something and get nothing back; Tesla looks like that kind of gamble.\n\nLooking ahead, electric vehicles will grow, but so will competition, regulation, and the need for constant capital spending on new factories and technology. That\u2019s not a recipe for the steady, compounding business I prize.\n\nCompared to the likes of Coca-Cola\u2014where we\u2019ve made multiple fortunes\u2014or Apple\u2019s ecosystem, Tesla is a high\u2010risk, capital\u2010hungry venture lacking a moat that I feel comfortable owning. My conclusion: the best answer here is no.",
