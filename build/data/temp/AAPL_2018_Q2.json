  "reasoning": "I\u2019ve spent more than six decades investing in businesses I understand inside and out. Apple clearly falls within my circle of competence \u2013 I view it as a consumer products company with a powerful ecosystem. But understanding a business is only the first step. \n\n1. Circle of Competence: Yes, I own Apple for its ecosystem, much like I own Coca-Cola for its brand. I know how people stick with their iPhones the way they stick with a good soft drink. \n\n2. Moat: Apple\u2019s brand strength and customer switching costs give it a moat, but the data shows an inconsistent ROE over ten years and only decent operating margins. A strong moat should translate into more consistent returns. \n\n3. Management Quality: Tim Cook and team have delivered solid products, but recent stock issuance that dilutes shareholders and a minimal dividend raise questions about capital allocation discipline. I like management to act like owners first. \n\n4. Financial Health & Consistency: A 10.9% ROE, debt/equity near 1.9, and negative earnings growth over ten periods (\u201324.7%) are red flags. I prefer companies with steady, predictable earnings and fortress-like balance sheets, and Apple\u2019s recent trend doesn\u2019t fit that mold. \n\n5. Valuation: Using a three-stage DCF, intrinsic value comes in around $130B after a 15% haircut. At a market cap of $786B, we have a margin of safety of \u201383%. As I always say, \u201cPrice is what you pay, value is what you get.\u201d Right now, you\u2019re paying far more than value. \n\n6. Long-Term Prospects & Red Flags: I admire Apple\u2019s long-term durability, but slowing growth in a maturing smartphone market, rising competition, and the commoditization of hardware worry me. Without attractive valuation, I\u2019d rather sit on my cash. \n\n7. Opportunity Cost: In my portfolio, I hold businesses like Coca-Cola, See\u2019s Candies and BNSF that generate reliable cash and have pricing power at reasonable prices. I\u2019d rather buy more of those than pay a premium here. \n\nIn short, Apple is a fine business, but at today\u2019s price and with these fundamentals, it doesn\u2019t meet my requirement of a margin of safety. I\u2019ll pass.",
