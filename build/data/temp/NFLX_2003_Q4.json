  "reasoning": "First off, streaming media isn\u2019t in my circle of competence. I stick to businesses I understand\u2014candy stores, insurance, banks, Brookshire rail cars and stable consumer brands. Netflix is part\u2010tech, part\u2010media, with a dizzying content budget I can\u2019t reliably forecast\u2014risk is what you don\u2019t know you\u2019re doing.\n\nOn the moat front, yes, Netflix enjoys strong operating margins (65%) but that hasn\u2019t translated into consistent ROE\u2014only 2% last year and zero out of seven periods above 15%. High content churn and fierce competition from Disney, Amazon and others mean no durable pricing power or switching costs akin to a Coke bottle or Mo\u00ebt & Chandon.\n\nManagement runs a lean show\u2014you won\u2019t find share issuance to dilute holders or dividends that drain cash\u2014but they pour owner earnings into new shows. Indeed, the DCF spits out negative owner earnings (\u2013$13m) and an intrinsic value so low it\u2019s negative. Capital allocation is aggressive content spending, not my idea of shareholder\u2010friendly.\n\nFinancially, Netflix shows a weak ROE of 2%, moderate debt with D/E of 0.56, and patchy earnings growth (0 out of 7 periods consistent). I like a fortress balance sheet and steady earnings\u2014Netflix has neither.\n\nValuation is the clincher: a three\u2010stage DCF yields a negative intrinsic value, and the margin of safety is below zero. As I always say, \u201cPrice is what you pay; value is what you get.\u201d Here, you\u2019re paying full freight for uncertain value.\n\nLong\u2010term prospects may look bright to some, but high content costs, subscriber saturation in developed markets, agile rivals, and no visible path to higher ROE spell trouble. I\u2019d rather own a wonderful business at a fair price than a fair business at a wonderful price.\n\nCompared to opportunities like Coca-Cola, Apple or Bank of America\u2014each with durable moats, strong returns on capital and shareholder\u2010friendly management\u2014Netflix simply doesn\u2019t compete in my playbook. My verdict: bear case stocks seldom make money for patient investors like me.",
