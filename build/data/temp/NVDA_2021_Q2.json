  "reasoning": "First off, Nvidia sits well outside my circle of competence. I know consumer staples, insurance, railroads and the occasional bank, but the semiconductor business\u2014with its cutting-edge fabs, wafer supply chains and Moore\u2019s Law clock speeds\u2014is not a world I understand deeply. That alone is enough to make me pause.\n\nOn its face, Nvidia shows blistering operating margins of 69%, suggesting some pricing power in GPUs. But its ROE has been inconsistent\u2014only 0 of 10 periods above 15%\u2014and the earnings growth pattern is all over the map despite a total 502% gain over ten years. Durable moats are built on predictable returns, and this one feels more cyclical and hit-driven than truly fortress-like.\n\nManagement has issued common stock recently, diluting existing holders, and pays little to no dividend. In the kinds of businesses I favor\u2014See\u2019s Candies or GEICO\u2014management thinks like owners and returns excess cash or reinvests it with discipline. Here I see capital raised and redeployed into a fast-changing game with high stakes.\n\nThe balance sheet carries a debt-to-equity ratio near 0.8, which is higher than I like, and we don\u2019t have a clear current ratio to confirm short-term safety. Inconsistent earnings patterns only add to my concern that this business isn\u2019t the perennial cash machine I prefer.\n\nValuation is the final nail. At a market cap of about $411 billion versus my most conservative intrinsic value of roughly $34.5 billion, we\u2019re looking at a negative 91% margin of safety. I\u2019d rather own Coca-Cola at 20 times earnings than buy excitement at an eye-popping price.\n\nYes, AI and data centers could drive Nvidia\u2019s fortunes for years, but rapid technological shifts can cut both ways. In contrast, I\u2019m perfectly happy holding Coca-Cola, Apple\u2019s ecosystem, BNSF\u2019s rail monopoly or a well-run insurer forever. When you\u2019re outside your circle and paying more than four times what you should, the answer is usually no. I\u2019ll sit this one out.",
