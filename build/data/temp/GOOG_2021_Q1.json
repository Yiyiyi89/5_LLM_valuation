  "reasoning": "1. Circle of Competence: I\u2019ve spent over six decades buying businesses I understand\u2014insurance, consumer staples, railroads, simple industrials. Google\u2019s search-and-ad platform and fast-moving tech innovation lie well outside my circle. As I often say, \"Risk comes from not knowing what you\u2019re doing,\" and I simply don\u2019t claim expertise in complex digital advertising or AI models.\n\n2. Competitive Moat: On paper, Google has a network effect\u2014more users mean better ad pricing\u2014but I\u2019m wary of tech moats that erode in a hurry. Without detailed data, I\u2019d be guessing whether their advantage will hold in 10 or 20 years.\n\n3. Management Quality: Sundar Pichai has shown capable stewardship, but with no insight into board incentives or capital allocation decisions here, I can\u2019t assess how shareholder-friendly they truly are. I prefer managers who think like owners\u2014see the way we run GEICO or how PepsiCo\u2019s leadership has deployed cash.\n\n4. Financial Health: The data provided shows no balance-sheet numbers or earnings consistency. A fortress balance sheet is one of our nonnegotiables. Without that, I wouldn\u2019t stake my reputation or capital.\n\n5. Valuation: Intrinsic value and margin of safety are the heart of our process. With no reliable estimate of cash flows or book value, I can\u2019t tell if Google sells at a bargain or a premium.\n\n6. Long-Term Prospects: The digital ad market can swing swiftly with regulatory changes, new platforms, or AI disruptors. I\u2019d rather own a business like Coca-Cola, which has raised prices for decades without losing customers, than sit through that uncertainty.\n\n7. Portfolio Comparison: We own Apple\u2014an exception in tech\u2014because it behaves like a consumer product company with a durable ecosystem. Google doesn\u2019t fit that mold. At Berkshire, I\u2019d take See\u2019s Candies or BNSF any day over a business I can\u2019t fully grasp.\n\nConclusion: This isn\u2019t a knock on Google\u2019s past success, but given my lack of clarity on key inputs\u2014quality, valuation, competitive durability\u2014I\u2019m inclined to pass. When in doubt, the answer is usually \u201cno.\u201d Better to miss an opportunity than put capital at risk when you\u2019re not sure of the prize.",
