  "reasoning": "First things first, Microsoft is not in my circle of competence. I own Apple because I view it as a consumer products business with a strong ecosystem \u2014 I understand that. But Microsoft is primarily an enterprise software and cloud business, full of shifting technology stacks and regulatory unknowns. That makes it a pass from the start. \n\nOn the moat front, yes, Microsoft has built durable advantages with Windows, Office and Azure that give it pricing power and scale. Its operating margins north of 80% speak to real strength, and the high performance stability (88.6%) is impressive. But a moat alone isn\u2019t enough if I can\u2019t confidently gauge how it holds up when AI demands and cybersecurity concerns reshape the landscape.\n\nManagement shows competence, but the recent stock issuance and lack of dividend leave me wanting more proof they put shareholders first. Capital allocation has been solid at times, but issuing new shares can dilute the long\u2010term owner\u2019s slice of the pie. I like managers who treat every dollar like their own \u2014 I\u2019m not fully convinced here.\n\nFinancially, Microsoft shines with strong margins, but a return on equity of just 12% and debt\u2010to\u2010equity near 0.9 raise caution flags. Inconsistent earnings growth and negative historical growth assumptions in the DCF signal volatility I\u2019m uncomfortable with. I want a rock solid stream of owner earnings, not swings that force me to guess how the next 10-K will read.\n\nValuation? The three-stage DCF pegs intrinsic value, even after a 15% haircut, at about $29,500. The market price implies a margin of safety of roughly \u201382%. I\u2019ve said many times, 'Price is what you pay; value is what you get.' Paying above value is a sure way to guarantee subpar returns.\n\nOver the long haul, I admire Microsoft\u2019s prospects, but the combination of complexity, issuance risk, and a price that dwarfs intrinsic value is a deal killer. Compare that to staying patient and adding to Coca-Cola or See\u2019s Candies at sensible prices \u2014 I know those businesses, their management, and I can sleep well at night. \n\nSo for Microsoft today, the answer is no. I\u2019d rather wait for clear skies in my own backyard than chase this one.",
