  "reasoning": "1. Circle of Competence \u2013 I\u2019ve built my record investing in simple businesses I can understand: consumer goods, insurance, banking and railroads. Netflix is a streaming-tech/content business full of rapidly changing tastes, platforms and competition. I\u2019d rather fish where the water\u2019s clear. NFLX sits outside my circle of competence.  \n2. Competitive Moat \u2013 You\u2019ve got scale, a big subscriber base and some brand recognition, but those advantages aren\u2019t durable. Competitors like Disney, Amazon and Apple have deep pockets and own the pipelines. Margins may be strong today (48.7% operating margin), but content costs are rising and churn remains a constant threat.  \n3. Management & Capital Allocation \u2013 Reed Hastings has done a fine job growing eyeballs, but the company keeps issuing shares and piling on debt (debt/equity 1.3). No dividend returns to owners and dilution is a real risk. I want managers who think like owners, not just fuel growth at any cost.  \n4. Financial Health & Consistency \u2013 ROE of 10.4% and ROIC of 4.5% are tepid for a growth stock. Earnings growth is inconsistent and the balance sheet carries heavy debt. You can\u2019t build a durable franchise if the financial foundation creaks every time you crank out a blockbuster.  \n5. Valuation vs. Intrinsic Value \u2013 Your DCF pegs intrinsic value at about $36,000 per share, conservatively $30,600 after a haircut. At today\u2019s prices the margin of safety is negative 89%. I\u2019m not inclined to overpay for a high-flyer with shaky fundamentals.  \n6. Long-Term Prospects & Red Flags \u2013 Streaming is a vicious arms race\u2014churn, price wars and ever-inflating content budgets. Nothing here suggests a \u2018forever business.\u2019 More likely, margin erosion five years down the road.  \n7. Comparison to My Portfolio \u2013 I\u2019d rather own a wonderful business like Coca-Cola, Apple or See\u2019s Candies at a fair price than a fair business like Netflix at a sky-high one. There\u2019s no penalty for sitting on cash and waiting for a genuine opportunity.  \nIn short, Netflix fails my first test\u2014circle of competence\u2014and it\u2019s trading well above a conservative appraisal of its worth. My answer is no.  ",
