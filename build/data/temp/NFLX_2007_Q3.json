  "reasoning": "First things first: NFLX lies outside my circle of competence. I don\u2019t pretend to understand the intricacies of streaming algorithms, content licensing and subscriber churn, so right off the bat I\u2019m at a disadvantage. In my 60 years I\u2019ve stuck to businesses I deeply understand \u2013 utilities, consumer staples, insurance and the like. \n\nThe moat here is questionable. Yes, Netflix has strong brand recognition and scale, but its inconsistent ROE (only 1 of 10 years above 15%), spotty earnings growth and limited pricing power suggest any advantage is neither wide nor enduring. A real economic moat means you can raise prices without losing customers; the data show Netflix has yet to prove that consistently. \n\nManagement has chosen to dilute shareholders through stock issuance rather than returning cash via dividends or buybacks. That\u2019s not how I like owners to think. Capital allocation should favor high returns for existing shareholders, not just fueling endless content spending. \n\nFinancially, Netflix looks shaky. Weak ROE of 3.6%, negative owner-earnings and an inconsistent earnings pattern are flags. A solid business should deliver steady, predictable cash flows \u2013 Netflix does not. \n\nValuation is another deal-killer. The three-stage DCF spits out a negative intrinsic value, meaning you\u2019d be paying for a business that generates negative free cash flow. A margin of safety of -108% is as wide a moat as you\u2019ll find \u2013 here in reverse. \n\nLong term, streaming remains competitive and capital hungry. New entrants and legacy studios with deep pockets will keep pushing costs and churn higher. I prefer businesses that earn profits consistently decade after decade with minimal need for reinvestment. \n\nCompare this to Coca-Cola, Apple or BNSF \u2013 companies with durable moats, predictable cash flows and simple economics. When in doubt, the answer is no. I see no reason to make an exception here. Bearish.",
