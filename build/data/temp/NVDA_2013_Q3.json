  "reasoning": "1. Circle of Competence: I\u2019ll be upfront\u2014semiconductors are outside my circle of competence. I don\u2019t pretend to understand the nitty-gritty of chip design, Moore\u2019s Law curves, or wafer fabrication complexities. If I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing, I don\u2019t invest. That\u2019s rule number one. \n\n2. Competitive Moat: NVIDIA certainly has built a moat around its GPU business\u2014strong and stable operating margins averaging 58.5% suggest pricing power. High performance stability (80.9%) points to sticky customer relationships. But chip cycles turn on a dime, and today\u2019s advantage can vanish with the next node. I\u2019d rather own a See\u2019s Candies or Coca-Cola, businesses that change little over decades. \n\n3. Management & Capital Allocation: I see recent stock issuances and no meaningful dividends. Issuing shares to fund growth can dilute long-term owners\u2014feels more like feeding a beast than returning capital. I admire management teams that think like owners and plow excess cash into high returns (like our partnership with Apple). Here I see zero evidence of shareholder-friendly moves. \n\n4. Financial Health & Consistency: Sure, debt is conservative at a 0.32 debt/equity ratio, but ROE sits at a tepid 2.7% and ROIC at 2.1%. Earnings growth has been negative over the past ten periods (\u201221.7%). That\u2019s the opposite of consistency. I want to see businesses that earn returns on capital well above their cost of capital year after year. \n\n5. Valuation: My three-stage DCF pegs intrinsic value at about $356 per share, and even after a 15% margin of safety it\u2019d be $302. At current prices north of twice that, you\u2019re paying a bargain basement price for future disappointment. A negative margin of safety of \u201296% tells you how richly valued NVIDIA is today. \n\n6. Long-Term Prospects & Red Flags: Artificial intelligence is all the rage, but hype is no substitute for durable economics. Chips get commoditized, and competing giants pour billions into catching up. I don\u2019t see the 20-year predictability I require. \n\n7. Opportunity Cost: I\u2019d much rather deploy capital into consumer staples, insurance, or banks where I can sleep at night. There\u2019s no penalty for saying no. \n\nConclusion: I\u2019m passing on NVIDIA. I\u2019d rather have a wonderful business at a fair price than a fair business at a wonderful price.",
