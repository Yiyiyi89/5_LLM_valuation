  "reasoning": "First off, this one falls outside my circle of competence. I\u2019ve spent over six decades investing in simple, consumer\u2010oriented businesses I can wrap my arms around\u2014Coca-Cola, See\u2019s Candies, Apple\u2019s ecosystem\u2014and I confess I don\u2019t fully grasp the nitty-gritty of Google\u2019s advertising algorithms, cloud offerings and AI initiatives. Having insufficient fundamental and moat data only reinforces that view.\n\nAs for a competitive moat, Google clearly has scale and network effects in search and digital ads. But I can\u2019t measure its durability or how quickly new AI rivals or regulation might chip away at that advantage. The management team is undoubtedly bright, yet Alphabet\u2019s history of pouring capital into moonshots\u2014some of which never pay off\u2014makes me uneasy about forecasting sensible capital allocation.\n\nWith no financials provided, I can\u2019t judge balance sheet strength, earnings consistency or intrinsic value. No margin of safety calculations here means I\u2019d be flying blind on price versus worth. Long term, the business might prosper; it might also face fierce competition from nimble players or political headwinds.\n\nCompared to opportunities I understand\u2014like Coca-Cola\u2019s pricing power or Apple\u2019s sticky ecosystem\u2014Google doesn\u2019t light me up. When in doubt, the answer is usually \u201cno.\u201d So I\u2019d pass and stick to the arenas I know best.",
