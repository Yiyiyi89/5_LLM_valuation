  "reasoning": "First off, Tesla isn\u2019t in my circle of competence. I\u2019ve spent 60 years buying simple businesses I understand\u2014cigarettes, candy, railroads\u2014not electric cars and complex software-driven assemblies. As I\u2019ve said, \u201cRisk comes from not knowing what you\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nOn a competitive moat, Tesla has a strong brand and early mover buzz, but making cars is a inherently capital-intensive, cyclical commodity business with no durable pricing power like See\u2019s Candies or Coca-Cola. Any advantage can be eroded by legacy automakers or new entrants.\n\nManagement under Elon Musk is undoubtedly visionary, but I look for teams that think like owners and steadily allocate capital. Tesla\u2019s negative owner earnings and episodic capital raises suggest a less predictable approach than Berkshire\u2019s disciplined capital allocation at GEICO or BNSF.\n\nFinancially, the numbers are troubling: ROE of \u201336.4%, negative ROIC, debt\u2010to\u2010equity over 2.2, inconsistent earnings with a 7-period earnings growth of \u2013111.6%. A three-stage DCF spits out a negative intrinsic value of roughly \u2013$1,820, leaving no margin of safety (MOS of \u20131.68).\n\nValuation is absurd when intrinsic value is negative. You can\u2019t pay less than zero. I\u2019d rather buy a wonderful business at a fair price than a fair business at a wonderful price.\n\nLong-term prospects? Electric vehicles may dominate, but there\u2019s no guarantee Tesla keeps a moat once others scale. I see red flags in execution risk, capital needs, and competition.\n\nCompared to opportunities in my portfolio\u2014say Apple\u2019s ecosystem or Coca-Cola\u2019s distribution\u2014I\u2019d put my chips elsewhere. My decision: bearish.",
