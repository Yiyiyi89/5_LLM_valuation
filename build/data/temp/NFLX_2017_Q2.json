  "reasoning": "First off, Netflix sits well outside my circle of competence. I understand consumer staples, insurance and railroads, but a constantly evolving streaming business with huge content spend and fickle subscriber tastes isn\u2019t one of them. It\u2019s like trying to pick a winner in a horse race when you\u2019ve never been to the track.\n\nIts moat is unproven. Sure, Netflix has a large subscriber base and decent operating margins (roughly 29%), but a durable competitive advantage? I don\u2019t see one. Its ROE is a meager 2.1% over the latest period and only once in ten years did it exceed 15%\u2014hardly what you\u2019d call a fortress. Competitors like Disney+ and Amazon are muscling in, and content costs keep ratcheting up.\n\nOn management and capital allocation, I\u2019ll give them credit for not flooding the market with new shares and for generating around $9 billion in owner earnings. But they\u2019ve leaned heavily on debt\u2014over four times equity\u2014and are locked in an arms race for content. No dividend, no buybacks\u2014your capital sits there while they reinvest aggressively in a business that hasn\u2019t shown consistent returns.\n\nFinancially you get strong operating margins, but a weak balance sheet and spotty earnings consistency. They grew total earnings 176% over ten periods, yet the pattern was all over the map. You don\u2019t want a roller coaster when you\u2019re planning to hold forever.\n\nValuation is the final nail. A three-stage DCF pegs conservative intrinsic value at about $136 a share. Netflix trades well above that, leaving you no margin of safety\u2014in fact, you\u2019re basically paying twice what I think the business is worth.\n\nLong term, streaming will matter, but the business model demands endless cash burn and content bets that may or may not pay off. That\u2019s not the kind of predictable, margin-rich, capital-light franchise I look for.\n\nCompared to owning Coca-Cola at 20 times earnings or Berkshire\u2019s insurance float, Netflix feels riskier and far more expensive. I\u2019d pass on it.",
