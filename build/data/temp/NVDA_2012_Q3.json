  "reasoning": "I\u2019d steer clear of Nvidia, and here\u2019s why. First off, semiconductor chips aren\u2019t in my circle of competence. I like businesses I can wrap my head around\u2014simple consumer products, insurance, banks, railroads\u2014not high-falutin tech where cycles and R&D swings can whipsaw you. Second, while Nvidia boasts strong operating margins\u2014akin to having pricing power in its GPU niche\u2014its return on equity has been under 15% in nine out of ten periods. That tells me its moat is sketchy and inconsistent. Third, management hasn\u2019t paid dividends, and there\u2019s minimal insight into their capital allocation beyond stock issuance. I\u2019d rather see managers who think like owners and steadily return cash. Fourth, the fundamentals look choppy\u2014ROE under 5% recently, erratic earnings growth, and an inconsistent track record. Fifth, the DCF pegs intrinsic value around $1,760 a share, yet the stock trades significantly above that. There\u2019s no margin of safety\u2014at today\u2019s lofty valuation you\u2019re risking a permanent loss of capital. Sixth, the long-term outlook for semiconductors is volatile: Moore\u2019s Law slows, competition intensifies, and end markets can shift on a dime. Finally, compared to owning Coca-Cola or Apple\u2014businesses with durable brands, simple economics, and predictable cash flows\u2014Nvidia fails to excite me. I\u2019ll pass and stick with companies I understand.",
