  "reasoning": "1. Circle of Competence: Streaming video is well outside my wheelhouse. I know consumer products, insurance, banks and the occasional select industrial, but Netflix belongs to the fast-changing tech/media world with high content costs. I\u2019d rather watch from the sidelines than pretend I understand the long-term game here.  \n2. Competitive Moat: While Netflix has scale, high operating margins (32% avg.) and a recognizable brand, content is expensive and competition from Disney, Amazon and HBO is fierce. A moat that requires continual multibillion-dollar content spending is hardly impregnable.  \n3. Management & Capital Allocation: Reed Hastings has done a fine job building a subscriber base, but management has leaned heavily on debt (D/E 3.6) and negative owner earnings (\u2013$5/share), signaling capital allocation into content at the expense of free cash flow.  \n4. Financial Health & Consistency: A weak ROE of 1.9%, inconsistent earnings growth and no current ratio data worry me. You don\u2019t want to build a business on borrowed dollars when the economy sneezes.  \n5. Valuation & Intrinsic Value: A three-stage DCF produces a negative intrinsic value (\u2013$48 raw, \u2013$41 conservative) and margin of safety of \u2013100%. You don\u2019t buy a business if you\u2019d owe money owning it.  \n6. Long-Term Prospects & Red Flags: The streaming market may consolidate, but heavy content investments, subscriber churn and pricing battles with deep-pocketed competitors create substantial risk.  \n7. Opportunity Cost: I\u2019d rather own a steady coke with a modest yield than a volatile streaming giant with negative owner earnings. In my view, NFLX is not a business I\u2019d buy at any price.\n",
