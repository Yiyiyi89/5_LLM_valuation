  "reasoning": "1. Circle of Competence: I\u2019ve spent my life in consumer staples, insurance, banks and simple industrials. Streaming video\u2014complex content deals, subscriber churn and tech infrastructure\u2014is outside my wheelhouse. As I always say, \u201cRisk comes from not knowing what you\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\n2. Competitive Moat: Netflix shows strong operating margins (avg ~38.6%) and has scale, but faces fierce competition from deep-pocketed rivals (Disney+, Prime, HBO Max). It lacks the enduring brand loyalty of a Coca-Cola or the pricing power of a See\u2019s Candies.\n\n3. Management & Capital Allocation: Hastings and company have been creative growing the business, but I frown on dilutive stock issuance and zero dividends. When you issue shares to fund content, you\u2019re betting growth stays ahead of dilution\u2014no sure thing.\n\n4. Financial Health & Consistency: ROE of 20.4% is impressive, but debt/equity north of 3.7 and spotty earnings growth raise red flags. A fortress balance sheet should be just that\u2014consistent earnings, manageable debt\u2014not a levered bet on subscriber momentum.\n\n5. Valuation vs. Intrinsic Value: Your DCF pegs intrinsic at $876, and even the raw number around $1,030 is well below today\u2019s market. A negative margin of safety (~-93%) tells me you\u2019re paying up for hopes, not value. \"Price is what you pay, value is what you get.\"\n\n6. Long-Term Prospects: I admire a business I can hold forever. Streaming is an arms race in content spending and tech. Unlimited upside? Maybe. But durable? I\u2019m skeptical.\n\n7. Opportunity Cost: I\u2019d rather own a wonderful business like Coca-Cola or Apple at a fair price than a fair business at a wonderful price. NFLX might be a fine business, but it\u2019s outside my circle and priced for perfection. My answer: No.",
