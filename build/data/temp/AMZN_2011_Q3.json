  "reasoning": "1. Circle of Competence: I come from a world of simple, predictable businesses\u2014Coca-Cola, See\u2019s Candies, GEICO\u2014not high-wire acts mixing razor-thin retail margins with a capital-hungry cloud business. Amazon straddles e-commerce, logistics, entertainment and cloud computing in a way that sits well outside my circle of competence. As I\u2019ve often said, \u201cRisk comes from not knowing what you\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\n2. Competitive Moat: While Amazon has built brand recognition and scale, the details show an inconsistent moat. Operating margins average an attractive 24.9%, but ROE has only topped 15% in 0 of 10 periods. A true durable moat would show consistent returns on equity and capital. This uneven performance suggests competitors can and do nip at its heels when it matters.\n\n3. Management Quality: Jeff Bezos and Andy Jassy have made bold investments, but owner earnings are deeply negative (-$489 million). There\u2019s minimal dividend or buyback discipline here\u2014capital allocation that plows losses back into expansion rather than steady cash returns. I admire ambition, but I prefer managers who think like owners and deliver reliable owner earnings (think GEICO or Burlington Northern).\n\n4. Financial Health & Consistency: A debt-to-equity ratio north of 1.45, ROIC near zero, and earnings growth down 55% over ten periods point to financial instability. In Berkshire\u2019s world, I look for consistent earnings growth and a fortress balance sheet. Amazon\u2019s numbers suggest volatility and high leverage\u2014too much risk of permanent capital loss.\n\n5. Valuation vs. Intrinsic Value: The three-stage DCF throws up a negative intrinsic value (\u2013$3,886 per share even after a 15% haircut) and a margin of safety of \u2013104%. Those aren\u2019t just red flags\u2014they\u2019re stop signs. I\u2019d rather buy a wonderful business at a fair price than a fair business at a wonderful price, and this one is neither wonderful nor fairly priced in my view.\n\n6. Long-Term Prospects & Red Flags: Yes, AWS could power future profits, and Prime drives loyal customers. But inconsistent returns, heavy reinvestment, and razor-thin retail margins pose significant long-term risks. I see no clear path to the type of predictable, decade-after-decade cash generation that Berkshire seeks.\n\n7. Comparison to My Portfolio: We already own durable businesses like Coca-Cola, Apple, and our railroads, which have simpler economics and pricing power. Why stretch into a complex, capital-hungry model with inconsistent returns? When in doubt, the answer is usually no. This one gets a clear no from me.",
