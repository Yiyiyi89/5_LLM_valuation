  "reasoning": "First, Apple squarely sits within my circle of competence as a consumer products company with a powerful device ecosystem and loyal customer base. It\u2019s like owning a toll bridge\u2014you don\u2019t need to reinvent the wheel every quarter. \n\nSecond, the moat is obvious: 10 out of 10 periods of ROE above 15%, averaging nearly 40%, plus stable operating margins around 47% demonstrate durable pricing power and switching costs that remind me of Coca-Cola\u2019s brand strength. \n\nThird, on management and capital allocation, Tim Cook\u2019s team has generally acted like owners\u2014returning cash via buybacks and dividends\u2014though the recent common stock issuance noted here is a wrinkle I\u2019d dig into. I prefer share repurchases over dilution, but I trust they\u2019ll keep capital disciplined. \n\nFourth, financially Apple is a fortress: strong ROE of 31.9%, roughly 50% margins, and manageable debt levels given its cash flows. The inconsistency in earnings growth (\u201331.7% over ten periods) reflects device cycle swings, not a broken business, but it\u2019s something to watch. \n\nFifth, valuation spells caution. A three-stage DCF pegs a conservative intrinsic value near $216,000 per share, yet the market price leaves us with a negative 91% margin of safety. I don\u2019t buy wonderful businesses at any price\u2014I look for a margin of safety. \n\nSixth, long-term prospects remain bright: the ecosystem, App Store economics, and loyalty are intact. No red flags on technology obsolescence, but I\u2019d rather see a better entry point. \n\nFinally, compared to opportunities in my portfolio\u2014Coca-Cola at a reasonable yield, Bank of America at a double-digit ROE valuation\u2014Apple today simply fails my price test. In Buffett terms, it\u2019s a wonderful business, but I\u2019ll sit on my hands until the price reflects its worth.",
