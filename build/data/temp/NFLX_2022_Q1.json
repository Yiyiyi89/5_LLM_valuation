  "reasoning": "This falls well outside my circle of competence \u2013 I\u2019ve spent my career on insurance, consumer brands and simple industrials, not navigating the economics of streaming and huge content spends. Netflix\u2019s moat appears limited: high operating margins hint at scale, but content is a treadmill and competitors (Disney+, Amazon Prime, HBO Max) all pressuring pricing power. Management has been bold, yet the debt\u2010to\u2010equity sits at 1.6 and ROE has only topped 15% zero times in the last decade, suggesting uneven capital allocation. Financial health is mixed: operating margins are strong, but ROE of 9.1%, patchy earnings consistency, and no reliable free cash flow invite caution. Valuation is the clincher \u2013 a market cap of $156 billion vs. a conservative intrinsic value of roughly $14 billion yields a negative margin of safety (about 91% overvalued). Long-term, rising content costs, saturation and tech disruption are red flags. Compared to owning a wonderful business at a fair price (think Coca-Cola or Apple), Netflix is a fair business at a wildly inflated price. I\u2019ll pass.",
