  "reasoning": "Well, forgive me if I jump right to the first principle \u2013 circle of competence. Google\u2019s business is rooted in complex algorithms, digital advertising auctions and cloud computing platforms. That\u2019s not a cake I know how to bake \u2013 my experience lies in simple, durable consumer brands, insurance float and railroads, not ad tech.\n\nSpeaking of moats, Google certainly has one. Its search engine and ad network are as entrenched as Coke\u2019s secret syrup, driven by scale, network effects and data advantages. In that regard, it reminds me of a wide moat business like Coca-Cola.\n\nOn management, Alphabet\u2019s team under Sundar Pichai is thoughtful and long-term oriented, allocating capital into AI and cloud while returning cash to shareholders. They strike me as honest operators, though I confess I haven\u2019t studied their decisions as closely as I have at companies like See\u2019s Candies or Geico.\n\nFinancially, they generate consistent profits and carry a strong balance sheet. But the digital ad market can be cyclical, and regulatory risk has crept onto my radar \u2013 a red flag I\u2019d need to understand more thoroughly.\n\nValuation is impossible to pin down with the data at hand. We\u2019ve got no revenue or earnings figures here, so assessing intrinsic value or margin of safety is out of reach.\n\nLong term, Google\u2019s scale and innovation could carry it forward two decades from now, but it\u2019s a fast-changing field. I\u2019d rather own an enduring franchise I truly grasp at a fair price.\n\nCompared to opportunities in my own backyard \u2013 consumer staples, insurance and rails \u2013 this one sits outside my wheelhouse. In the absence of enough data or deep familiarity, I\u2019m inclined to sit this dance out.\n\nIn short, this is a wonderful business by many measures, but it\u2019s outside my circle. My default when in doubt is usually \u2018no.\u2019",
