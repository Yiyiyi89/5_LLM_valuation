  "reasoning": "First off, Nvidia lies well outside my circle of competence. I\u2019ve spent 60 years sticking to businesses I can wrap my head around \u2013 consumer staples, insurance, railroads \u2013 not cutting-edge semiconductors and AI chips. As I always say, \u201cRisk comes from not knowing what you\u2019re doing,\u201d and I don\u2019t know enough about the long-term economics of GPU pricing or AI competition to feel comfortable.\n\nOn the moat, Nvidia shows strong margins of nearly 60%, which hints at some pricing power, but its ROE has been inconsistent (only 0 of 10 periods above 15%) and earnings have tumbled by 7.6% over the last ten reports. A true durable moat delivers predictable returns on capital, and I\u2019m not seeing that here.\n\nManagement has raised equity recently and pays no dividends \u2013 both strike me as signs they\u2019re more focused on growth at any cost than returning cash to owners. Buffett-style capital allocators think like owners and allocate wisely; issuing shares when the stock\u2019s trading around five times my conservative intrinsic value estimate certainly isn\u2019t that.\n\nThe balance sheet carries a debt-to-equity of 0.6 and uneven earnings. A truly strong financial fortress would deliver consistent owner earnings, and Nvidia\u2019s 4.4% ROE and 2.7% ROIC don\u2019t convince me of enduring financial strength.\n\nValuation is the final nail in the coffin. My three-stage DCF pegs fair value near $1,842, yet the stock trades well above $10,000 market cap per share equivalent \u2013 a price to intrinsic value gap that screams negative margin of safety of over 80%. Remember, \u201cPrice is what you pay, value is what you get.\u201d Here, you\u2019re paying far more than you\u2019ll ever receive in predictable cash flow.\n\nLong term, AI buzz may keep Nvidia in the headlines, but durable competitive advantages matter more than hype. I\u2019d much rather own a business like Apple in my portfolio \u2013 simple products, loyal customers, strong cash returns, and a management team that thinks like partners. In this case, Nvidia fails my very first test: circle of competence. I\u2019ll pass.",
