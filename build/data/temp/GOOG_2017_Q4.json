  "reasoning": "First things first: does Alphabet fall inside my circle of competence? I know enough about digital advertising and the power of data, but the nitty-gritty of search algorithms, machine learning platforms and AI moonshots isn\u2019t what I\u2019ve spent my life studying. I\u2019d call that outside my core comfort zone.\n\nAs for a moat, Google certainly enjoys scale, network effects and entrenched advertising relationships, giving it strong pricing power in its market. Management under Sundar Pichai has proven capable, maintaining profitability while funding ambitious R&D. Financially, Alphabet sits on a fortress of cash with consistent free cash flow and minimal debt.\n\nBut with no reliable intrinsic valuation in hand and uncertain future tech shifts, there\u2019s no clear margin of safety. Compared to businesses like Coca-Cola, Apple or BNSF\u2014where I can forecast cash flows decades out\u2014I\u2019d rather wait for a simpler, well-understood opportunity. In short, I\u2019ll sit on the sidelines for now.",
