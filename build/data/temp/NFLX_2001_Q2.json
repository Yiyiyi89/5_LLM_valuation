  "reasoning": "This one falls outside my circle of competence. I\u2019ve spent my life buying simple, cash-generating businesses I can understand \u2013 soda pop, insurance, railroads \u2013 not digital content factories. When I don\u2019t understand the economics, I pass. \n\n1. Circle of Competence: Streaming video is a fast-changing, capital-intensive business with thin margins and constant content bidding wars. I can\u2019t model subscriber churn or content hit rates reliably, so I stay away. \n2. Moat: Netflix has brand recognition and scale, but as soon as Disney, Amazon and others decided to build their own services, it lost exclusivity on marquee titles. Its moat looks more like a sandcastle that needs constant rebuilding. \n3. Management: Hastings and company are creative operators, but producing original shows means huge upfront costs and unpredictable returns. They\u2019re smart folks, but I\u2019d prefer managers with a track record of allocating capital in simple, proven businesses. \n4. Financial Health: We have no dependable numbers here \u2013 the data provided is nil. My rule: \u2018Rule No.1, never lose money. Rule No.2, never forget rule No.1.\u2019 With no visibility on cash flow or debt, I can\u2019t risk my owners\u2019 capital. \n5. Valuation: Without an intrinsic estimate or margin of safety, I\u2019m flying blind. Price is what you pay; value is what you get. I can\u2019t tell what I\u2019m getting. \n6. Long Term Prospects: A decade from now, competition will only be stiffer, content costs higher, and subscriber fatigue a real threat. That\u2019s not a durable franchise in my book. \n7. Portfolio Comparison: I\u2019d rather hold a wonderful business like Coca-Cola or Bank of America at a fair price than try to guess wins and losses in Hollywood. For me, this opportunity earns a polite \u2018no thank you.\u2019 There\u2019s no shame in saying \u2018I don\u2019t understand it enough to invest.\u2019",
