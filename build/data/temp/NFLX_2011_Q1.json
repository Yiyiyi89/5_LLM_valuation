  "reasoning": "First, Netflix isn\u2019t in my circle of competence. I understand consumer brands, banks, insurance and simple industrials, but a capital-intensive streaming tech/content model sits outside that circle. Second, its competitive moat seems shallow. Yes, Netflix shows strong operating margins (about 40%) and ROE north of 21%, but it faces fierce competition from deep-pocketed rivals like Disney+ and Amazon. Third, management has executed well on growth, yet repeated stock issuances dilute shareholders and they\u2019ve layered on debt instead of building a fortress balance sheet. Fourth, financial consistency is lacking. Debt-to-equity is nearly 3:1, earnings growth has been uneven, and we lack a clear current ratio. Fifth, valuation is rich. A three-stage DCF pegs intrinsic value around $1,013, or about $861 after a 15% haircut, but the market price leaves no margin of safety. Sixth, long-term prospects are uncertain in a crowded, fast-evolving field without durable pricing power. Finally, compared with my favorites like Coca-Cola, Apple, GEICO or See\u2019s Candies at fair prices, Netflix is a fair business at too rich a price. When in doubt, the answer is no \u2013 I\u2019ll pass on NFLX.",
