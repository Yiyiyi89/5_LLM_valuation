  "reasoning": "1. Circle of Competence: I don\u2019t invest in complex technology or commodity retail. Amazon\u2019s blend of e-commerce, cloud computing (AWS) and content distribution sits well outside my simple, branded consumer staples and insurance businesses. 2. Competitive Moat: AWS has some pricing power, but the e-commerce side is a low-margin, cut-throat business. Inconsistent ROE (7.4% average) and only 2 of 10 periods above 15% suggest a moat that isn\u2019t durable enough for my taste. 3. Management Quality: Jeff Bezos is resourceful, but Amazon\u2019s capital allocation favors perpetual growth over shareholder returns. No dividends and ongoing aggressive reinvestment dilute returns. 4. Financial Health: A debt-to-equity ratio of 2.7 is heavier than I\u2019m comfortable with, and ROIC of just 2.0% points to a poor return on capital. Earnings patterns are inconsistent despite book value growth. 5. Valuation: My three-stage DCF pegs intrinsic value around $54,500 per share, implying a negative margin of safety of roughly 93%. I\u2019d rather own a wonderful business at a fair price than this. 6. Long-Term Prospects and Red Flags: AWS growth may sustain returns, but the competitive landscape is fierce and regulatory risk looms. 7. Relative Opportunity: I\u2019d much rather put capital into proven brands like Coca-Cola or a well-capitalized insurer at reasonable valuations. In short, Amazon is overvalued, outside my circle, and fails to clear my margin-of-safety hurdle.",
