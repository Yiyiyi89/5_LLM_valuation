  "reasoning": "First off, let me tell you right away: streaming video is not in my circle of competence. I don\u2019t fully grasp the long-term economics of subscriber churn, content licensing auctions, or the endless bidding wars Netflix wages with tech giants. Buffett Rule #1 is to stick to what you know \u2013 I\u2019d much rather buy a strong consumer brand or a simple utility than try to outfox Silicon Valley.\n\nOn the moat front, Netflix shows glimmers of pricing power in its 32% operating margins, but inconsistent ROE (only 1.3% last year and none above 15% in the past decade) tells me rivals can erode that edge. Content is expensive and easily replicated. That\u2019s not a fortress \u2013 it\u2019s a drawbridge with a hinge built by Amazon, Disney, Apple and others.\n\nManagement has been smart at scaling the service, but they\u2019ve loaded up on debt (3.8\u00d7 equity) and burned cash on original programming. I like owner-friendly capital allocators, but here the balance sheet looks more stretched than GEICO\u2019s in a bad hurricane year.\n\nFinancially, earnings swing all over (total growth 879.4% over ten periods but no steady pattern), and owner earnings today (~$7 per share) earn me an intrinsic value of about $59. Netflix trades well above that. With a negative margin of safety, I\u2019d be paying more than twice what I believe the business is worth.\n\nCompare that to my holdings \u2013 Coca-Cola\u2019s brands, BNSF\u2019s rails, Apple\u2019s ecosystem \u2013 where I understand the economics, see durable moats, and am offered a meaningful discount to intrinsic value. Netflix, to me, is richly priced, outside my competency, and carries too many risks for a long-term stake. My favorite holding period is forever \u2013 this isn\u2019t forever material at any price in sight.",
