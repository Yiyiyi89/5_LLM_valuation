  "reasoning": "Well, the first thing I look at is whether the business falls inside my circle of competence. Google\u2014now Alphabet\u2014is essentially an advertising and data-analytics machine built on complex algorithms and fast-moving technology. That\u2019s not a straightforward consumer staple like Coca-Cola or a simple industrial like UPS. I\u2019ve said, \u201cRisk comes from not knowing what you\u2019re doing,\u201d and at this point, I don\u2019t have enough on the underlying fundamentals or precise moat details to feel comfortable.\n\nOn the moat question, I know Alphabet enjoys scale in search and online ads, and there\u2019s a network effect in its data collection\u2014advertisers go where the users are. But without more detailed moat analysis, it\u2019s hard to gauge durability. Will privacy regulations, algorithm changes, or competition from other platforms erode pricing power over 10 or 20 years? I can\u2019t tell.\n\nAs for management, Sundar Pichai and the board have steered Alphabet profitably, yet I\u2019ve got no concrete data on capital allocation decisions, share repurchases, or how they\u2019re deploying free cash flow to enhance shareholder value.\n\nFinancial health and consistency? Everyone knows Alphabet generates mountains of cash and solid returns on equity, but the information provided offers no historical earnings, balance-sheet, or free-cash\u2010flow figures. I can\u2019t confirm whether they carry worrisome debt or maintain a fortress balance sheet.\n\nValuation: I\u2019ve not been given an intrinsic\u2010value estimate or margin of safety. And I\u2019ve long held that \u201cprice is what you pay, value is what you get.\u201d Without that anchor, I can\u2019t know if today\u2019s price leaves a sufficient margin of safety.\n\nLong\u2010term prospects: I\u2019m sure Google will still be around, but technology evolves. I\u2019d worry about regulatory crackdowns, shifting user behavior, or a disruptive competitor. I\u2019d rather bet on businesses I understand down to their economics.\n\nIn my own portfolio, I hold companies like Coca-Cola, Apple, Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s insurance businesses, and banks where I see simple, predictable economics and honest capital allocation. Given the lack of data here and the complexity of the business, I\u2019ll pass for now. In Buffett-speak, I\u2019d rather own a wonderful business at a fair price than a fair business at a wonderful price\u2014this one\u2019s neither wonderful nor fairly priced in my view, at least on the information provided.",
