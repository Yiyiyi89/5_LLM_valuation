  "reasoning": "First things first, Nvidia sits well outside my circle of competence. I\u2019ve spent my career understanding simple, enduring businesses\u2014soft drinks, insurance, retail, railroads\u2014not the intricacies of GPU architectures or semiconductor roadmaps. Risk comes from not knowing what you\u2019re doing, and I don\u2019t fully know this business.\n\nOn the question of a moat, Nvidia may enjoy a lead in AI chips today, but technology moves like a fast freight train. Durable competitive advantages\u2014like Coca-Cola\u2019s brand or See\u2019s Candies\u2019 customer loyalty\u2014aren\u2019t terribly evident here, since competitors can catch up with new fabs or architectures.\n\nManagement looks capable in execution and focused on R&D, but I can\u2019t speak to their long-term capital allocation beyond the data. There\u2019s little or no dividend, and they\u2019ve taken on debt\u2014debt to equity of 1.5\u2014leaner businesses I own tend to run balance sheets considerably cleaner.\n\nFinancially, operating margins are strong, but return on equity is just 7.7% and return on invested capital barely 3%. That\u2019s not the kind of fortress I seek. Consistency data is spotty, and high leverage in a cyclical industry can bite you when demand shifts.\n\nValuation is the clincher: a three-stage DCF pegs intrinsic value at roughly $146, yet the market trades almost double that. The margin of safety is deeply negative. I\u2019d rather own a wonderful business at a fair price than gamble on this high-flying levered story.\n\nLong-term prospects for AI may look bright, but rapid change and fierce competition introduce lots of uncertainties. Compared to opportunities in my portfolio\u2014like Apple for its ecosystem, Coca-Cola for its moat, or BNSF for its predictable cash flows\u2014I\u2019d pass. When in doubt, the answer is usually no.",
