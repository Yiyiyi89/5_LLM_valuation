  "reasoning": "1. Circle of Competence: Amazon falls outside my wheelhouse. I don\u2019t pretend to understand the ever-changing logistics, cloud computing and razor-thin retail economics the way I do a soft drink or an insurance franchise. As I\u2019ve said, \u201cRisk comes from not knowing what you\u2019re doing,\u201d and I don\u2019t know how to forecast the next turn in a business that burns capital, issues stock, and shifts strategy every few years.  2. Moat: While Amazon has scale and Prime switching costs, its return on equity is a meager 2.1% and barely positive owner earnings. A durable moat should show up in consistent 15%-plus ROEs\u2014Amazon delivers nothing of the sort.  3. Management & Capital Allocation: They\u2019re talented folks running a sprawling empire, but they\u2019ve issued new stock recently, diluting shareholders, and paid no dividends. I prefer managers who think like owners and return cash when the business doesn\u2019t have higher-return reinvestment opportunities.  4. Financial Health & Consistency: ROIC sits near zero, debt-to-equity exceeds 2\u00d7, owner earnings are negative and growth has been erratic (-45% over 10 periods). A true financial fortress doesn\u2019t post red ink in its DCF or swing from boom to bust.  5. Valuation: The three-stage DCF spits out a negative intrinsic value of roughly $-236,000 per share equivalent, and the margin of safety is glaringly negative. You can\u2019t buy a store for less than nothing.  6. Long-Term Prospects & Red Flags: Sure, they\u2019ll grow sales, but returns on capital remain too low and the business eats cash. I see no catalyst for dramatic margin expansion. In retail and cloud, competition from Walmart, Microsoft, Alibaba and others looms large.  7. Better Opportunities: I\u2019d rather own a great business like Coca-Cola at a fair price, or Apple for its consumer ecosystem and cash returns, than gamble on capital-intensive ventures with modest profits. In short, I\u2019ll pass on Amazon.",
