  "reasoning": "First off, Microsoft sits largely outside my circle of competence. I\u2019m a simple soul who understands consumer brands, insurance, banks and railroads\u2013not the ins and outs of enterprise software, cloud infrastructure and rapidly evolving tech stacks. \n\nOn the one hand, Microsoft exhibits some hallmarks of a moat business\u2013its operating margins north of 70% point to genuine pricing power and sticky customer relationships. In that sense it reminds me a bit of Coke\u2019s long innings or IBM\u2019s early days. But the similarity ends there. \n\nDigging into the numbers, I see a weak return on equity of about 9%, a return on invested capital under 3%, and a debt\u2010to\u2010equity north of 2.2. For a business with supposedly rock\u2010solid cash flows, those returns feel more tepid than I\u2019d like. Management\u2019s recent share issuance and a lack of meaningful dividends also raise questions about capital allocation priorities\u2013it\u2019s not exactly the Buffett playbook. \n\nFinancial consistency is another concern. Microsoft\u2019s earnings have grown in fits and starts rather than in steady, predictable strides. And though a three-stage DCF pegs a conservative intrinsic value in the $60\u2013$70 range, today\u2019s price leaves you with a negative margin of safety of nearly 90%. I\u2019d much rather own something like Apple at a fair price or Coca-Cola at a reasonable valuation. \n\nLong term, Microsoft will doubtless remain a force in enterprise tech. But at today\u2019s valuation, I\u2019m not prepared to turn over capital to a business I don\u2019t fully grasp when I can buy wonderful, straightforward businesses trading at sensible prices. As my old partner Charlie Munger says, \"Invert, always invert\u2013what you want to avoid is permanent loss of capital.\" Here, the price dictates a hard pass.",
