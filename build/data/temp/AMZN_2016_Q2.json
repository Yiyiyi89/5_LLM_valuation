  "reasoning": "First off, Amazon lies well outside my circle of competence. I\u2019m a simple fellow who likes to invest in businesses I can understand inside and out\u2014soft drinks, insurance, railroads and the like. E-commerce platforms, cloud computing and the constant reinvestment cycle at Amazon feel more like rocket science than selling hamburgers or insuring cars. Risk comes from not knowing what you\u2019re doing, and I don\u2019t know Amazon\u2019s world as I do Coca-Cola or See\u2019s Candies.\n\nOn the moat front, Amazon\u2019s operating margins have been strong\u2014averaging 38%\u2014but its return on equity has been a modest 5.2% and returns on invested capital barely above 1%. That tells me pricing power in its cloud business doesn\u2019t make up for razor-thin retail margins. A durable moat shows up in consistent high returns on capital, and Amazon\u2019s numbers have swung all over the map.\n\nManagement is undoubtedly smart\u2014Jeff Bezos has done remarkable things\u2014but they plow almost every dollar back into new initiatives instead of returning capital to shareholders. I\u2019ve never met a company that couldn\u2019t find more ways to spend money, but my preference is for executives who act like owners and put money to work at high rates of return. Amazon\u2019s debt-to-equity ratio of nearly 3-to-1 also gives me pause.\n\nFinancially, the story is mixed. You see inconsistent earnings growth and a weak ROE, offset only by book value growth. For a business to earn my wholehearted support, I want predictability, fortress-like balance sheets and consistent cash generation. That\u2019s not plainly evident here.\n\nValuation is the clincher. Using a three-stage DCF, intrinsic value comes in around $4,740 a share, and yet Amazon trades near double that level. As I like to say, \u201cPrice is what you pay; value is what you get.\u201d Here, you\u2019d be paying far more than the business is worth on a conservative estimate. A negative margin of safety of almost 100% is a flashing red light.\n\nLong-term prospects? Undoubtedly Amazon will remain a big company. But big doesn\u2019t always translate into great returns for shareholders. I\u2019d rather own a wonderful business at a fair price than chase a complex operation at a lofty valuation.\n\nCompared to opportunities in my portfolio\u2014Coca-Cola selling at reasonable multiples or Apple yielding tidy returns\u2014I see no compelling case for buying Amazon today. I\u2019ll sit this one out.",
