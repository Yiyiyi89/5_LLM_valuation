This project implements a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline that fuses structured firm-quarter fundamentals from our financial database with a curated corpus of Warren Buffett’s shareholder letters and interviews. By feeding both sources into a large-language-model back-end, the system generates concise, Buffett-style commentary on each firm’s quarterly performance—bridging hard data with legendary investment insights in a single, automated workflow.
